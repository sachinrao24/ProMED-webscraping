This isn\\'t normal in healthy freshwater wetland systems,\" Jordan said.Jordan says the Waikato Regional Council needs to take a hard look at how the system is managed and limit discharges into these waterways to help decrease the likelihood and severity of these incidents continuing to occur in the future.\"There have been long-term systemic failures in freshwater policies and a lack of implementation that has caused severe degradation in our freshwater ecosystems. Lake Waikare, one of the Southern Hemisphere\\'s most polluted lakes, has also been diverted into the wetland as part of the flood control scheme, which is adding even more nutrients to the wetland,\" she said.Degradation of waterways and associated environments, coupled with predictions of longer hotter summers, means these types of botulism outbreaks are likely to become more common, Jordan said.Fish and Game New Zealand\\'s southern game bird manager for the Auckland and Waikato region, David Klee, says the situation is grim.\"Botulism is symptomatic of severely degraded ecosystems and this area is being adversely impacted by human activity to the point where its resilience is severely compromised,\" Klee said.\"Fish and Game, the Department of Conservation, Mana Whenua, and hunter volunteers, in conjunction with contractors, have recovered close to 1500 dead birds and rescued hundreds of sick ones from the wetland, an important step in trying to minimise the size and scale of the outbreak.\"Klee says Fish and Game NZ is doing everything it can with the limited resources available, however, many parts of the wetland area, covering 7000 ha, are inaccessible.\"It is an appalling situation both in terms of animal welfare and the environmental impact,\" he said.[Byline: Benjamin Plummer]--Communicated by:ProMED[Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacteria _Clostridium botulinum_. These bacteria are widespread in soil and require warm temperatures, a protein source, and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and produce toxin. Decomposing vegetation and invertebrates combined with warm temperatures can provide ideal conditions for the botulism bacteria to activate and produce toxin. There are several types of toxin produced by strains of these bacteria; birds are most commonly affected by type C and to a lesser extent type E. - Mod.PMBProMED map of New Zealand: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8709052,68925>]',\n",

       " 'The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stated today (17 Mar 2023) that the avian influenza epidemic in domestic poultry farms continues to heat up. A few days ago, a poultry farm detected H9N2 virus, which was the 1st time that this subtype of the virus was detected in a poultry farm in our country.Personnel should wear personal protective equipment and practice respiratory hygiene when working. If you have flu-like symptoms, you should seek medical attention as soon as possible and inform the medical staff of TOCC (travel history, occupation history, contact history, and cohort history), and the general public should also reduce contact with birds.The CDC pointed out that for the domestic poultry farms where the H9N2 subtype virus was detected, the health unit has assisted the personnel involved in culling and clearing the farms to assist them in putting on and taking off their personal protective equipment, and has compiled a list and carried out health checks as soon as possible. Currently, there are 21 contact people, of which 20 prevention-and-control personnel and 1 poultry farm personnel. None of them have flu-like symptoms. Regarding contacts related to the domestic bird flu epidemic since January 2023 (47 outbreaks), a total of 695 people have been listed in the health management tracking; no human case of new type A influenza has been found.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stated that since 2013, sporadic human cases of H9N2 infection have been continuously reported internationally. So far, at least 97 cases have been reported, of which 7 are young children. There are 8 severe cases and 2 deaths (all with a history of chronic diseases). In Asia, nearly 90% of the cases occurred in China. The latest case was a mild case in Hunan Province, China in November 2022. According to the WHO risk assessment of H9N2 dated 24 Feb 2023, most of the cases were found as exposed to poultry or contaminated environments. As the virus continues to circulate in poultry, sporadic human cases are expected to continue, but current evidence shows that it has not obtained the ability to transmit from person to person (human to human). The possibility of community transmission is low, though occasional cases of human infection may occur and close monitoring is required. H9N2 is currently a novel influenza A subtype with \"low\" disease severity in humans.The Department of Disease Control and Prevention reminds that due to the continuous occurrence of domestic poultry epidemics, the respiratory secretions and excreta of poultry infected with avian influenza may contain viruses. Entering the human body, the risk of human exposure and infection increases, and livestock-related workers are urged to wear personal protective equipment during work. In order to prevent the new type A influenza, doctors are urged to ask patients meeting the notification requirements (as laid out in the attachment at <https://www.cdc.gov.tw/File/Get/6fydaRrKYG7AmF3hCo85Hw>; in Chinese) their TOCC (travel history, occupation history, contact history, and cohort history). In case found suspected, they must report it as soon as possible.--Communicated by:ProMED[H9N2 viruses, an LPAI (low pathogenic avian influenza) subtype, have become globally widespread and hyperendemic in poultry in many areas of Eurasia and Africa. They represent a genuine threat both to the global poultry industry but also to humans through their high rates of zoonotic infection and pandemic potential. Stamping out, which involves culling infected and exposed birds and birds presenting influenza-related morbidity, has occasionally been used as a 1st line of defence against H9N2 in countries without a history of the virus. This was the case during early outbreaks in Korea, Russia, and Ghana. However, once the virus becomes endemic in a country, stamping out becomes uneconomical and unfeasible, therefore vaccination is commonly used beyond this point. Many countries including China, Israel, South Korea, Morocco, Pakistan, Egypt, Iran, and UAE have adopted vaccination at either a national or local level as a key approach for preventing H9N2 disease in poultry.(ref: Peacock THP, James J, Sealy JE, Iqbal M. A global perspective on H9N2 avian influenza virus. Viruses. 2019; 11(7): 620; <https://doi.org/10.3390/v11070620>).It remains to see what control policy has been decided upon by Taiwan\\'s animal health authorities following the discovery of the virus. A well-weighed decision depends upon the availability of accurate information about the rate of the pathogen\\'s current distribution. - Mod.ASProMED map:Taiwan: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8709046,193>]']"
