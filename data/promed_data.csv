A deadly outbreak of avian botulism in Waikato's Whangamarino Wetland has killed thousands of birds, including some rare indigenous species.

Fish and Game New Zealand say it's ""yet another wake-up call for urgent action"" to be taken by the Waikato Regional Council.

""The latest outbreak of the deadly bacterium, which produces a toxin that can paralyse and kill birds, follows multiple and increasing outbreaks during summers in and around the Waikato region over the past decade [2010-2019],"" Fish and Game New Zealand said in a press release on its website [<https://fishandgame.org.nz/news/regional-council-must-act-on-deadly-botulism-outbreaks/>].

Poor water quality and changes to water flows as a result of human activities contribute to low oxygen levels, creating the perfect growing conditions for these bacteria.

""This results in fish dying, followed by birds before botulism spreads to other surrounding wetland environments,"" Fish and Game New Zealand said, calling it ""yet another wake-up call for urgent action.""

The Whangamarino Wetland is the 2nd-largest freshwater wetland in the North Island, covering almost 7000 hectares [about 17 300 acres] in Waikato, and was chosen as one of 3 nationally-significant wetland sites in the Department of Conservation's Arawai Kākāriki wetlands restoration programme [<https://www.doc.govt.nz/our-work/freshwater-restoration/arawai-kakariki-wetland-restoration/sites/whangamarino/>].

Fish and Game New Zealand chief executive Corina Jordan says the outbreak is an appalling situation and has had a massive impact on fish and bird populations in these wetlands.

""Parts of this wetland have been without oxygen for the best part of 3 months, leading to massive aquatic deaths of even the hardiest freshwater species such as eels. This isn't normal in healthy freshwater wetland systems,"" Jordan said.

Jordan says the Waikato Regional Council needs to take a hard look at how the system is managed and limit discharges into these waterways to help decrease the likelihood and severity of these incidents continuing to occur in the future.

""There have been long-term systemic failures in freshwater policies and a lack of implementation that has caused severe degradation in our freshwater ecosystems. Lake Waikare, one of the Southern Hemisphere's most polluted lakes, has also been diverted into the wetland as part of the flood control scheme, which is adding even more nutrients to the wetland,"" she said.

Degradation of waterways and associated environments, coupled with predictions of longer hotter summers, means these types of botulism outbreaks are likely to become more common, Jordan said.

Fish and Game New Zealand's southern game bird manager for the Auckland and Waikato region, David Klee, says the situation is grim.

""Botulism is symptomatic of severely degraded ecosystems and this area is being adversely impacted by human activity to the point where its resilience is severely compromised,"" Klee said.

""Fish and Game, the Department of Conservation, Mana Whenua, and hunter volunteers, in conjunction with contractors, have recovered close to 1500 dead birds and rescued hundreds of sick ones from the wetland, an important step in trying to minimise the size and scale of the outbreak.""

Klee says Fish and Game NZ is doing everything it can with the limited resources available, however, many parts of the wetland area, covering 7000 ha, are inaccessible.

""It is an appalling situation both in terms of animal welfare and the environmental impact,"" he said.

[Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacteria _Clostridium botulinum_. These bacteria are widespread in soil and require warm temperatures, a protein source, and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and produce toxin. Decomposing vegetation and invertebrates combined with warm temperatures can provide ideal conditions for the botulism bacteria to activate and produce toxin. There are several types of toxin produced by strains of these bacteria; birds are most commonly affected by type C and to a lesser extent type E. - Mod.PMB

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stated today (17 Mar 2023) that the avian influenza epidemic in domestic poultry farms continues to heat up. A few days ago, a poultry farm detected H9N2 virus, which was the 1st time that this subtype of the virus was detected in a poultry farm in our country.

Personnel should wear personal protective equipment and practice respiratory hygiene when working. If you have flu-like symptoms, you should seek medical attention as soon as possible and inform the medical staff of TOCC (travel history, occupation history, contact history, and cohort history), and the general public should also reduce contact with birds.

The CDC pointed out that for the domestic poultry farms where the H9N2 subtype virus was detected, the health unit has assisted the personnel involved in culling and clearing the farms to assist them in putting on and taking off their personal protective equipment, and has compiled a list and carried out health checks as soon as possible. Currently, there are 21 contact people, of which 20 prevention-and-control personnel and 1 poultry farm personnel. None of them have flu-like symptoms. Regarding contacts related to the domestic bird flu epidemic since January 2023 (47 outbreaks), a total of 695 people have been listed in the health management tracking; no human case of new type A influenza has been found.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stated that since 2013, sporadic human cases of H9N2 infection have been continuously reported internationally. So far, at least 97 cases have been reported, of which 7 are young children. There are 8 severe cases and 2 deaths (all with a history of chronic diseases). In Asia, nearly 90% of the cases occurred in China. The latest case was a mild case in Hunan Province, China in November 2022. According to the WHO risk assessment of H9N2 dated 24 Feb 2023, most of the cases were found as exposed to poultry or contaminated environments. As the virus continues to circulate in poultry, sporadic human cases are expected to continue, but current evidence shows that it has not obtained the ability to transmit from person to person (human to human). The possibility of community transmission is low, though occasional cases of human infection may occur and close monitoring is required. H9N2 is currently a novel influenza A subtype with ""low"" disease severity in humans.

The Department of Disease Control and Prevention reminds that due to the continuous occurrence of domestic poultry epidemics, the respiratory secretions and excreta of poultry infected with avian influenza may contain viruses. Entering the human body, the risk of human exposure and infection increases, and livestock-related workers are urged to wear personal protective equipment during work. In order to prevent the new type A influenza, doctors are urged to ask patients meeting the notification requirements (as laid out in the attachment at <https://www.cdc.gov.tw/File/Get/6fydaRrKYG7AmF3hCo85Hw>; in Chinese) their TOCC (travel history, occupation history, contact history, and cohort history). In case found suspected, they must report it as soon as possible.

[H9N2 viruses, an LPAI (low pathogenic avian influenza) subtype, have become globally widespread and hyperendemic in poultry in many areas of Eurasia and Africa. They represent a genuine threat both to the global poultry industry but also to humans through their high rates of zoonotic infection and pandemic potential. Stamping out, which involves culling infected and exposed birds and birds presenting influenza-related morbidity, has occasionally been used as a 1st line of defence against H9N2 in countries without a history of the virus. This was the case during early outbreaks in Korea, Russia, and Ghana. However, once the virus becomes endemic in a country, stamping out becomes uneconomical and unfeasible, therefore vaccination is commonly used beyond this point. Many countries including China, Israel, South Korea, Morocco, Pakistan, Egypt, Iran, and UAE have adopted vaccination at either a national or local level as a key approach for preventing H9N2 disease in poultry.

It remains to see what control policy has been decided upon by Taiwan's animal health authorities following the discovery of the virus. A well-weighed decision depends upon the availability of accurate information about the rate of the pathogen's current distribution. - Mod.AS

.................................................mo/arn/mj/jh","The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stated today (17 Mar 2023) that the avian influenza epidemic in domestic poultry farms continues to heat up. A few days ago, a poultry farm detected H9N2 virus, which was the 1st time that this subtype of the virus was detected in a poultry farm in our country.Personnel should wear personal protective equipment and practice respiratory hygiene when working. If you have flu-like symptoms, you should seek medical attention as soon as possible and inform the medical staff of TOCC (travel history, occupation history, contact history, and cohort history), and the general public should also reduce contact with birds.The CDC pointed out that for the domestic poultry farms where the H9N2 subtype virus was detected, the health unit has assisted the personnel involved in culling and clearing the farms to assist them in putting on and taking off their personal protective equipment, and has compiled a list and carried out health checks as soon as possible. Currently, there are 21 contact people, of which 20 prevention-and-control personnel and 1 poultry farm personnel. None of them have flu-like symptoms. Regarding contacts related to the domestic bird flu epidemic since January 2023 (47 outbreaks), a total of 695 people have been listed in the health management tracking; no human case of new type A influenza has been found.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stated that since 2013, sporadic human cases of H9N2 infection have been continuously reported internationally. So far, at least 97 cases have been reported, of which 7 are young children. There are 8 severe cases and 2 deaths (all with a history of chronic diseases). In Asia, nearly 90% of the cases occurred in China. The latest case was a mild case in Hunan Province, China in November 2022. According to the WHO risk assessment of H9N2 dated 24 Feb 2023, most of the cases were found as exposed to poultry or contaminated environments. As the virus continues to circulate in poultry, sporadic human cases are expected to continue, but current evidence shows that it has not obtained the ability to transmit from person to person (human to human). The possibility of community transmission is low, though occasional cases of human infection may occur and close monitoring is required. H9N2 is currently a novel influenza A subtype with ""low"" disease severity in humans.The Department of Disease Control and Prevention reminds that due to the continuous occurrence of domestic poultry epidemics, the respiratory secretions and excreta of poultry infected with avian influenza may contain viruses. Entering the human body, the risk of human exposure and infection increases, and livestock-related workers are urged to wear personal protective equipment during work. In order to prevent the new type A influenza, doctors are urged to ask patients meeting the notification requirements (as laid out in the attachment at <https://www.cdc.gov.tw/File/Get/6fydaRrKYG7AmF3hCo85Hw>; in Chinese) their TOCC (travel history, occupation history, contact history, and cohort history). In case found suspected, they must report it as soon as possible.--Communicated by:ProMED[H9N2 viruses, an LPAI (low pathogenic avian influenza) subtype, have become globally widespread and hyperendemic in poultry in many areas of Eurasia and Africa.

The 1st cases of plants with citrus greening disease have been confirmed in Uruguay, according to a health emergency note released by the country's Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries. Plants with symptoms were found in a residence in Artigas Department.

After laboratory analysis, the presence of the disease was confirmed. Inspections were carried out in the surroundings of the outbreak and no new positive cases were detected. Measures were adopted to prevent the spread of the disease, including constant monitoring of homes and farms following an action plan developed earlier for the management and control of citrus greening.

[Citrus greening (CG) is one of the most damaging diseases of the crops, affecting leaves and fruit. It is caused by fastidious phloem-inhabiting bacteria classified as _Candidatus_ Liberibacter asiaticus (CaLas; Asian greening; huanglongbing), africanus (including a subsp. capensis; African greening) or americanus (South American greening). The 3 pathogens can only be distinguished by molecular methods. Several phytoplasma species have been reported to cause symptoms similar to greening disease in citrus; coinfections of phytoplasmas with CaLas have also been recorded (e.g. ProMED posts 20180214.5629251, 20190329.6392077). Further research is needed on symptomatology, epidemiology, and host impact of both single and mixed infections of these pathogens.

Symptoms may include blotchy mottling and yellowing of leaves, as well as small, irregularly shaped fruits with a thick, pale peel and bad taste. Early symptoms may be confused with nutrient deficiencies. Affected trees become stunted, bear multiple off-season flowers, and may live for only a few years without ever bearing usable fruit. CG is restricted to _Citrus_ and close relatives because of the narrow host range of its psyllid vectors. The pathogens can also be spread by grafting and possibly by seed from infected plants or transovarially in the vector insects. Both pathogens and vectors can be spread with plant material.

Disease management requires an integrated approach including use of clean planting and grafting stock, elimination of inoculum, use of pesticides for vector control in orchards, as well as chemical or biological control of vectors in non-crop reservoirs. Control using cultural methods, such as interplanting with non-host crops, is being trialled. In areas where a pathogen has not yet been detected, biological control of vectors has been used successfully to reduce insect numbers and, therefore, the risk of greening outbreaks (see, for example, ProMED post 20090601.2034). Antibiotics as leaf sprays, seed treatments, or trunk injections are being used occasionally to treat CG (e.g. ProMED posts 20181119.6154764, 20190320.6377319), but are subject to strict regulations in most countries due to their associated risks of facilitating the emergence of antibiotic resistances in other crop, animal, and human pathogens. Furthermore, beneficial soil microbes may be killed off as collateral damage, making the plants weaker and more susceptible to other diseases. Residues of antibiotics may also lead to rejection of exported produce by some countries.

In South America, citrus in colder areas has been found less affected by CG (ProMED post 20201207.7999673), possibly due to vector insects in colder temperatures being less active. However, elsewhere citrus psyllids have been found at increasing altitudes (ProMED post 20161129.4660906), potentially due to increasing overall temperatures there. This reflects similar effects observed for other pathogens and pests (e.g. ProMED posts 20160902.4459660, 20160622.4302098, 20160509.4211696) migrating to new areas in many regions due to warming climates.

In the report above, it is not specified which of the 3 liberibacters has been identified in Uruguay. While CaLas appears to be the likely pathogen, both the Asian and South American species are present in neighbouring Brazil and other parts of the region.

<https://noticiasbariloche.com.ar/chubut-salud-confirmo-un-nuevo-caso-de-hantavirus-en-el-maiten/>


The Chubut Ministry of Health, through the Esquel Program Area, confirmed this Friday [17 Mar 2023] the detection of a new case of hantavirus [infection] in the Andean region, relating to a minor residing in the town of El Maitén, who is currently hotpitalized in the Zonal Hospital in Esquel, with good clinical progress.

This endemic event was ratified by the Andean hospital laboratory, after carrying out the appropriate tests.

The case in question is a minor who, after presenting symptoms compatible with the disease, was initially treated at the El Maitén health center, and was later referred to the Zonal Hospital of Esquel given the complexity of the clinical picture.

Given this and following the national norms that establish the procedures to be carried out in the event of the appearance of a case of hantavirus [infection], once the situation was reported, technical teams of Epidemiology, Mental Health, Environmental Health, and Community Health Workers in the Field of the Programmatic Area in Esquel moved to the town of El Maitén to continue with the investigation of the episode together with the health teams of the local hospital. They are also implementing the pertinent preventive measures and alert guidelines, as well as the identification of close contacts and their consequent respiratory isolation.

The main actions carried out throughout Friday [17 Mar 2023] included:
- the deepening of field research to identify close contacts
- the corresponding respiratory isolations
- the subsequent monitoring and containment of close contacts during the days following exposure;
- the detection of suspected symptomatic persons; and,
- as a final result of the identification of the activities carried out for the confirmed case, the execution of an environmental focus control, including the placement of traps to capture rodents and virus isolation from them.

It should be noted that having identified that some of the close contacts are also minors, with attendance at the Buenos Aires Chico agrarian school, during the final hours of Friday [17 Mar 2023] a meeting was held between the health teams and the educational community to inform and work jointly on the actions and care guidelines that support and bring peace of mind to adolescents and their families.

The provincial Ministry of Health requests that those involved in health and education in the affected area reinforce prevention messages, placing special emphasis on the need to refrain from going to work, school, social, or family activities in case of symptoms compatible with the disease, among which are fever of 38 deg C [100.4 F] or higher, muscle aches, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or diarrhea without involvement of the upper airways.

In addition, it is vitally important to remember that the incubation period of the virus fluctuates between 7 and 45 days, for which the development of focus control actions for close contacts of a positive case becomes greatly relevant, as well as is the implementation of preventive environmental practices, to avoid the appearance of secondary cases.

Finally, the Provincial Directorate of Prevalent Pathologies and Epidemiology, an agency of Chubut Health detailed that hantaviruses are transmitted mainly by inhalation of virus-laden aerosols from feces, urine, or saliva of infected rodents. Other possible routes of transmission are contact of the conjunctival, nasal, or oral mucosa with excrement or secretions of infected rodents, and the bites of infected rodents. There is also evidence of airborne transmission from person to person.

Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome can present as a mild condition with a non-specific febrile syndrome or manifest in a more serious form with severe respiratory failure and cardiogenic shock, so it is extremely important to go to the closest healthcare provider when the 1st symptom appears.

[There were several cases of hantavirus infections in Chubut province last year (2022) including 2 cases with infections acquired in the Los Alerces National Park of Chubut province (see ProMED posts listed below).

There is no indication in the report above of the environmental setting where this boy might have acquired his infection. The health agency's investigation may determine that and is informing the public in that locality about preventive measures for avoiding infection.

Although the virus involved in the case above and the previous ones is not mentioned, the most likely virus involved is Andes virus, found in western Argentina in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_. There is also the possibility of infection with Seoul hantavirus, which is widely distributed in the world in brown rats (_Rattus norvegicus_). Andes virus can also be transmitted directly between people in close physical contact. That is why close contacts of the positive case are under surveillance in case of transmission from the case above. - Mod.TY

.................................................mo/lxl/ty/mj/jh","The Chubut Ministry of Health, through the Esquel Program Area, confirmed this Friday [17 Mar 2023] the detection of a new case of hantavirus [infection] in the Andean region, relating to a minor residing in the town of El Maitén, who is currently hotpitalized in the Zonal Hospital in Esquel, with good clinical progress.This endemic event was ratified by the Andean hospital laboratory, after carrying out the appropriate tests.The case in question is a minor who, after presenting symptoms compatible with the disease, was initially treated at the El Maitén health center, and was later referred to the Zonal Hospital of Esquel given the complexity of the clinical picture.Given this and following the national norms that establish the procedures to be carried out in the event of the appearance of a case of hantavirus [infection], once the situation was reported, technical teams of Epidemiology, Mental Health, Environmental Health, and Community Health Workers in the Field of the Programmatic Area in Esquel moved to the town of El Maitén to continue with the investigation of the episode together with the health teams of the local hospital. They are also implementing the pertinent preventive measures and alert guidelines, as well as the identification of close contacts and their consequent respiratory isolation.The main actions carried out throughout Friday [17 Mar 2023] included:- the deepening of field research to identify close contacts- the corresponding respiratory isolations- the subsequent monitoring and containment of close contacts during the days following exposure;- the detection of suspected symptomatic persons; and,- as a final result of the identification of the activities carried out for the confirmed case, the execution of an environmental focus control, including the placement of traps to capture rodents and virus isolation from them.It should be noted that having identified that some of the close contacts are also minors, with attendance at the Buenos Aires Chico agrarian school, during the final hours of Friday [17 Mar 2023] a meeting was held between the health teams and the educational community to inform and work jointly on the actions and care guidelines that support and bring peace of mind to adolescents and their families.The provincial Ministry of Health requests that those involved in health and education in the affected area reinforce prevention messages, placing special emphasis on the need to refrain from going to work, school, social, or family activities in case of symptoms compatible with the disease, among which are fever of 38 deg C [100.4 F] or higher, muscle aches, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or diarrhea without involvement of the upper airways.In addition, it is vitally important to remember that the incubation period of the virus fluctuates between 7 and 45 days, for which the development of focus control actions for close contacts of a positive case becomes greatly relevant, as well as is the implementation of preventive environmental practices, to avoid the appearance of secondary cases.Finally, the Provincial Directorate of Prevalent Pathologies and Epidemiology, an agency of Chubut Health detailed that hantaviruses are transmitted mainly by inhalation of virus-laden aerosols from feces, urine, or saliva of infected rodents. Other possible routes of transmission are contact of the conjunctival, nasal, or oral mucosa with excrement or secretions of infected rodents, and the bites of infected rodents. There is also evidence of airborne transmission from person to person.Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome can present as a mild condition with a non-specific febrile syndrome or manifest in a more serious form with severe respiratory failure and cardiogenic shock, so it is extremely important to go to the closest healthcare provider when the 1st symptom appears.[Byline: Laura Alves]--Communicated by:ProMED[There were several cases of hantavirus infections in Chubut province last year (2022) including 2 cases with infections acquired in the Los Alerces National Park of Chubut province (see ProMED posts listed below).There is no indication in the report above of the environmental setting where this boy might have acquired his infection. The health agency's investigation may determine that and is informing the public in that locality about preventive measures for avoiding infection.Although the virus involved in the case above and the previous ones is not mentioned, the most likely virus involved is Andes virus, found in western Argentina in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_. There is also the possibility of infection with Seoul hantavirus, which is widely distributed in the world in brown rats (_Rattus norvegicus_). Andes virus can also be transmitted directly between people in close physical contact. That is why close contacts of the positive case are under surveillance in case of transmission from the case above. - Mod.TYProMED map of Argentina: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8709044,68924>]","Noticias Bariloche, Noticials del Bolsón, report",,

Catch-up immunization for children whose immunization status is incomplete, especially in areas where vaccination coverage is below 70 percent

The Health Service (Dinkes) of Garut Regency, West Java, said that the number of deaths due to the diphtheria epidemic in the area had increased to 9 people from a total of 14 positive cases.

""Yes, one (added) from Cisurupan, aged 9,"" said Garut District Health Office Secretary Leli Yuliani in Garut on Friday [17 Mar 2023].

He said Garut Regency had determined the diphtheria case as an Extraordinary Event (KLB) until November 2023 to provide optimal health services.

Previously, he said, 8 people died of diphtheria in February 2023; now one more has increased [the tally] to 9 people.

The condition of the diphtheria patient who died, he said, was because he had not received the complete diphtheria vaccination as recommended by the government.

The existence of the death case, said Leli, made his staff continue to increase immunization efforts by pursuing the target of vaccination among children.

""Chase immunization for children whose immunization status is incomplete, especially in areas where vaccination coverage is below 70 percent,"" he said. He said that currently the focus is on vaccination in the Pangatikan District area because many cases of diphtheria have been found in that area.

In addition to massive vaccinations, he said, his staff also continues to socialize efforts to prevent and treat diphtheria to the people in Garut.

Based on reports from the Garut Health Office, positive diphtheria patients have gradually improved, and some have been declared cured.

CDC issues enterovirus warning
------------------------------
Two cases of enterovirus 71 (EV71) were reported last week, the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said yesterday, adding that it was a warning sign, as the virus has not been detected for more than a year.
 
Parents are advised to remind their children to practice good hand hygiene, it said.
 
Guo Hung-wei, director of the CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Center, said that 165 230 people visited a hospital for diarrhea last week, which is a high number.
 
Most of the diarrhea case clusters were caused by norovirus infection, but there were also enterovirus cases, and weekly caseloads are slowly increasing, Guo said.
 
Most of last week's enterovirus cases had Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), but 2 young children in northern Taiwan had EV71, weekly enterovirus data showed.
 
One of the EV71 cases is a 1-year-old boy who had a fever and fatigue, while the other is a 4-year-old girl who had a fever, sore throat and mouth ulcers, CDC physician Lin Yung-ching said.

While their family members did not have symptoms, classmates at their nursery and preschool had enterovirus infections, Lin said.
 
""EV71 infection can cause nervous system complications, including encephalitis, meningitis and even acute flaccid paralysis,"" he said.
 
Mild symptoms include herpangina (blister-like sores in the mouth and throat) and foot-and-mouth disease, Lin said, adding that the 4-year-old girl's ulcers were a typical symptom.
 
""There has been no enterovirus outbreak in the past 3 years, so many young children have never been infected with an enterovirus and do not have immunity, making cluster infections more likely,"" he said.
 
Enteroviruses mainly spread through respiratory droplets and direct contact with contaminated objects, so parents should remind their children to wash their hands frequently and wear a mask if they have symptoms, Lin said.
 
People should seek medical attention if suspected symptoms occur and rest at home, he added.
 
CDC Deputy Director-General Philip Lo said the 2 EV71 cases are a warning sign, as the virus has not been detected in Taiwan for more than a year.
 
There have been large outbreaks in the past, and the virus can cause severe complications, so the CDC plans to tell healthcare facilities to be cautious and ask schools and parents to remind young children to practice good hand hygiene, he said.
 
Children aged 5 or under are at higher risk of severe complications, and parents should seek medical attention immediately if their children are persistently sleepy or repeatedly vomiting, or if they have concentration issues, fatigue, weakness of the limbs, myoclonic jerks, shortness of breath or a rapid heartbeat when their body temperature is normal, Lin said.
 
Meanwhile, 3 cases of severe flu complications were reported last week: one with the influenza A (H1N1) virus and 2 with the influenza A (H3N2) virus, Lin said, adding that they were all over the age of 50 and did not get vaccinated this flu season.
 
Separately, the Central Epidemic Command Center yesterday [14 Mar 2023] reported 9860 new local COVID-19 cases, 225 imported cases and 28 deaths.
 
The local case count is 8.8% lower than it was on Tuesday [7 Mar 2023] last week, it said.

[EV71 was first isolated from the faeces of a female suffering from encephalitis in 1969 in California. However, a retrospective study conducted in the Netherlands indicated that the virus could have emerged as early as 1963; a finding consistent with reports of possible worldwide EV71 epidemics in the late 20th century, throughout the world and with epidemics in Asia, Europe and the Americas. EV71 virus causes a range of effects from asymptomatic infection and mild HFMD to neurological disease with severe central nervous system complications and cardiopulmonary failure. In severe cases mortality rates can be high, especially in children aged 5 years and younger. EV71 is considered to be the most severe neurotoxic enterovirus and severe EV71 disease has become a major public health problem in China.

Enterovirus 71 vaccines
-----------------------
To date 3 vaccines against EV71 have been licensed in China, all using C4 genogroup strains. The efficacy of these 3 vaccines after 2 doses of immunization ranges from 90.0% to 97.4% after one year of surveillance to 95.1% after 2-year follow-up. Candidate vaccines containing B4 and B5 genogroups are in development elsewhere but have not yet reached the licensing stage. Other vaccines such as recombinant and other forms of subunit vaccines, vectored vaccines, and virus-like particle vaccines are in the early stages of development. In addition, the development of vaccines against Coxsackie A16, A6 and A10 is being considered with a view to developing combination/multivalent vaccines. (<https://bit.ly/3ZXYZeH>)

In other previous news from 2022, a Taiwan-made enterovirus 71 vaccine was forecast to hit the market in 2023. 

""The phase 3 clinical trial of a vaccine for the enterovirus 71 (EV71) virus which is safe for babies as young as 2 months has been successful, a research team announced on Thursday [5 May 2022], expecting it to hit the market in early 2023.

Children aged 5 or under are at higher risk of severe complications, and parents should seek medical attention immediately if their children are persistently sleepy or repeatedly vomiting, or if they have concentration issues, fatigue, weakness of the limbs, myoclonic jerks, shortness of breath or a rapid heartbeat when their body temperature is normal, Lin said. Meanwhile, 3 cases of severe flu complications were reported last week: one with the influenza A (H1N1) virus and 2 with the influenza A (H3N2) virus, Lin said, adding that they were all over the age of 50 and did not get vaccinated this flu season. Separately, the Central Epidemic Command Center yesterday [14 Mar 2023] reported 9860 new local COVID-19 cases, 225 imported cases and 28 deaths. The local case count is 8.8% lower than it was on Tuesday [7 Mar 2023] last week, it said. [Byline: Lee I-chia]--Communicated by:ProMED from HealthMap Alerts[EV71 was first isolated from the faeces of a female suffering from encephalitis in 1969 in California. However, a retrospective study conducted in the Netherlands indicated that the virus could have emerged as early as 1963; a finding consistent with reports of possible worldwide EV71 epidemics in the late 20th century, throughout the world and with epidemics in Asia, Europe and the Americas. EV71 virus causes a range of effects from asymptomatic infection and mild HFMD to neurological disease with severe central nervous system complications and cardiopulmonary failure. In severe cases mortality rates can be high, especially in children aged 5 years and younger. EV71 is considered to be the most severe neurotoxic enterovirus and severe EV71 disease has become a major public health problem in China.Enterovirus 71 vaccines-----------------------To date 3 vaccines against EV71 have been licensed in China, all using C4 genogroup strains. The efficacy of these 3 vaccines after 2 doses of immunization ranges from 90.0% to 97.4% after one year of surveillance to 95.1% after 2-year follow-up. Candidate vaccines containing B4 and B5 genogroups are in development elsewhere but have not yet reached the licensing stage. Other vaccines such as recombinant and other forms of subunit vaccines, vectored vaccines, and virus-like particle vaccines are in the early stages of development. In addition, the development of vaccines against Coxsackie A16, A6 and A10 is being considered with a view to developing combination/multivalent vaccines. (<https://bit.ly/3ZXYZeH>)In other previous news from 2022, a Taiwan-made enterovirus 71 vaccine was forecast to hit the market in 2023. ""The phase 3 clinical trial of a vaccine for the enterovirus 71 (EV71) virus which is safe for babies as young as 2 months has been successful, a research team announced on Thursday [5 May 2022], expecting it to hit the market in early 2023.

Polio-free Pakistan 'evasive dream' as 1st case of 2023 reported
----------------------------------------------------------------
Pakistan has reported its 1st polio case of 2023 after a 3-year-old boy in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Bannu district became the latest victim of the crippling disease, the health ministry confirmed on Friday [17 Mar 2023].

The case has been reported at a time when delegations of the French Agency for Development (FAD) and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) are in the country to analyse efforts to eradicate the disease. According to a statement issued by the health ministry on Friday [17 Mar 2023], the FAD and BMGF delegations met the federal health minister to discuss avenues for cooperation in social protection and health, with a focus on polio eradication.

The head of the National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC) for Polio, Dr Shahzad Baig, said an investigation is ongoing to identify whether the child received the vaccination or if the parents had refused vaccination. ""However, it is clear that the child was not fully protected and that is why [he was] attacked by the virus,"" Dr Baig said while talking to Dawn.

He said this was the 1st case of the current year [2023] which has been reported after a gap of 5 months. Health authorities have issued an alert on the back of the expected movement from tribal districts to urban areas in Ramadan and Eid. The authorities are now planning a vaccination drive in tribal districts from 10 Apr 2023 as currently, security personnel are engaged in the digital census.

The NEOC head said there were 7 districts in southern KP, including Dera Ismail Khan, Lakki Marwat, Tank, Bannu, South Waziristan and North Waziristan where the virus is prevalent. ""(These areas) need to be targeted vigorously in the vaccination campaign."" The region was the epicentre of the virus in 2022 with all 20 cases being reported from districts in southern KP. Of them, 17 were from North Waziristan, 2 from Lakki Marwat and 1 from South Waziristan.

While a polio campaign was carried out in Sindh, Punjab and Islamabad in March [2023], the drive couldn't be started in KP and Balochistan as security staff was occupied with census duties.

Support of international community
----------------------------------
The BMGF is one of the biggest contributors supporting Pakistan's efforts to end the virus. The visits are aimed at identifying Pakistan's needs and understanding areas for support in light of the 2022 floods, which left more than 33 million people in need of aid. During the meeting on polio eradication, Minister Abdul Qadir Patel said the health service infrastructure was severely damaged in many districts as a result of floods.

""Thousands of people lost their homes and livelihoods, placing a severe strain on social protection mechanisms. We are still recovering, but despite these toughest of times, Pakistan has not diluted its focus from polio eradication,"" the health ministry's statement said, quoting Mr Patel. The Gates Foundation delegation was led by Jay Wenger, the global head for polio eradication, while the FAD delegation was headed by Agnès Soucat, the director of health and social protection.

The delegations appreciated the progress made by Pakistan in 2022 and hoped that the virus, restricted to 7 districts, will soon be eradicated. ""Thanks to the generous support of the international community, Pakistan has been aggressively fighting the poliovirus,"" the health minister said. 

The delegation admired the ""political commitment at all levels"" to eradicate the virus, according to the statement.
 
Earlier this year in January [2023], environmental samples from Lahore -- the 2nd biggest city after Karachi -- tested positive for the polio virus, prompting the authorities to start a vaccination campaign in 26 union councils of the city.

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Thursday [16 Mar 2023] said 32 patients were admitted in Mumbai of whom 4 have been diagnosed with H3N2 and the remaining 28 with H1N1. All patients are in a stable condition, the BMC's public health department said.

The BMC also stated that wards E (Byculla, Mazgaon), D (Tardeo, Girgaum, Walkeshwar), F South (Parel, Sewri), F North (Matunga, Sion), G South (Worli, Lower Parel, Prabhadevi) and G North (Dharavi, Shivaji Park) are high-risk areas as they have reported the maximum number of cases of influenza.

Measures taken by BMC to curb the spread of influenza include:
- Treatment of all suspected cases with Oseltamivir if the fever is not decreasing within 24 hours.
- Oseltamivir has been made freely available at all municipal hospitals, dispensaries, medical colleges and maternity homes in Mumbai.
- Daily house to house survey to identify fever patients and people who are possibly exposed to risk.
- Health awareness activities are conducted in the community with help of posters, health talks and short movies.

On Wednesday [15 Mar 2023], Maharashtra health minister Tanaji Sawant had informed the state Assembly that 352 patients in the state have been diagnosed with the H3N2 virus so far.

""H3N2 is not fatal. It can be cured through proper medical treatment. There is no need to panic,"" he had said. He also said that 2 persons had died due to influenza, including a 23-year-old 1st-year student of MBBS in Ahmednagar, who tested positive for COVID-19 as well as H1N1 and H3N2 viruses. Another victim is a 74-year-old man from Nagpur, who died of H3N2.

Meanwhile, Chief Minister Eknath Shinde chaired a meeting to review the health department's preparedness to tackle H3N2, an official release said. ""If treated early, influenza can be cured. This should be known to everyone,"" he was quoted as saying.

Shinde further directed authorities to ensure that the ongoing strike of government employees for the Old Pension Scheme does not impact the treatment of patients at government hospitals. He added that the private medical sector should be roped in if needed.

The total number of confirmed cases of influenza and the number of cases of influenza A decreased in week 10. The number of cases of influenza B was at the same level in week 10 as in week 9, after several weeks of increase. The spread of both influenza A and B is estimated to be ongoing throughout the country. Several newly admitted intensive care patients are still reported every week. Confirmed cases that died within 30 days of sampling continue to be reported as well. It is important that those who are sick with respiratory symptoms stay at home and avoid close contact with others. In this week's special episode, you can read more about other causes of respiratory infection.

The Public Health Agency, together with the Infection Control Unit in the Orebro County region, is investigating a few cases of influenza B with serious complications that have been reported in the region. The cases, which have been among people under the age of 18 without an underlying disease or condition, have been very seriously ill with complications such as myocarditis or encephalitis. It is already known that the reported complications can occur in connection with influenza infection, but this is unusual. The investigation aims to assess whether there are more influenza B cases with serious complications than expected and whether there is any common contributing cause in addition to the influenza infection. Therefore, the Public Health Authority has asked other infection control units to investigate whether there are similar cases in other regions. The Public Health Authority is also investigating whether there are similar accumulations of cases in other European countries, but nothing of the sort has been reported so far. Virological analyses show that all Swedish characterized influenza B strains in the 2022-2023 season, including samples from severe cases, belong to the same genetic group of lineage type B/Victoria that dominates in the rest of Europe and is included in the season's influenza vaccines.

Since 14 Mar 2023 Region Orebro County has been offering, in consultation with the Public Health Authority, school-age children free vaccination against influenza for a limited period.

During week 10, a total of 749 cases of influenza A and B were reported, which is 8% fewer than the previous week. The sampling and the percentage of positives were largely at the same level as in week 9, see Table 1 [tables and figures available at source URL].

So far this season, the majority of all reported cases have been influenza A, but the proportion of influenza B cases has increased in recent weeks. During week 10, there were roughly the same number of cases of influenza A (385 cases) as influenza B (364 cases). Between weeks 9 and 10, the number of cases of influenza A decreased by 13%, while influenza B was unchanged, after increasing for several weeks. Of subtyped influenza A samples during the season, 53% have been influenza A(H1)pdm09 and 47% have been influenza A(H3). Line typing of influenza B samples shows that only B/Victoria is circulating. The number of influenza B cases per week is at about the same level as the corresponding week in the 2019-2020 season, when B/Victoria last circulated, but significantly lower than the intensive influenza B/Yamagata season of 2017-2018, see Figure 1B.

The number of cases of influenza per 100 000 inhabitants was unchanged in all parts of the country and remained highest in Svealand. There was no statistically significant difference in the number of cases per 100 000 in any age group between weeks 9 and 10, either overall or for influenza A and influenza B, respectively. Compared to the average for the previous 3 weeks, cases of influenza A decreased in all age groups. For the influenza B cases, no statistically significant changes were seen compared to the average value for the previous 3 weeks. During week 10, for influenza A there were the most cases per 100 000 in the age group 65 years and older, and correspondingly for influenza B there were the most cases in the age group of 0-4 years.

So far, 11 newly admitted patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza have been reported in intensive care during week 10, of which 6 are with influenza A and 5 with influenza B. The reported number of patients treated in intensive care is estimated to be slightly higher due to a delay in reporting. So far this season, 231 intensive care patients have been reported, of which 207 had influenza A and 24 had influenza B. The median age of the intensive care patients was 60 years for those with influenza A and 17 years for those with influenza B. Overall, 71% of all patients belonged to a medical risk group based on an underlying disease or condition or were 65 years of age or older. Among people under the age of 65, 53% belonged to a medical risk group. During the season, 46 people under the age of 18 were reported admitted to intensive care.

Due to a delay in the reporting of deaths, the analysis of deaths focuses on data up to 2 weeks ago. During week 8, 15 deaths were reported within 30 days of influenza diagnosis. For the previous 3 weeks (weeks 5-7), the average was 25 deaths per week. To date [17 Mar 2023], 18 and 15 confirmed cases have been reported deceased during weeks 9 and 10, respectively. Since week 40, 503 deceased confirmed cases have been reported to date [17 Mar 2023], with a median age of 83 years. Of these, 97% have had influenza A. In week 8, mortality in Sweden was within the normal range according to the excess mortality model EuroMoMo.

Within the sentinel sampling, 6 samples have been received for week 10. Two samples were positive for influenza B/Victoria and one sample was positive for influenza A(H1)pdm09, the other 3 samples were negative.

Web searches show unchanged flu activity in Sweden compared to the previous week. The level is lower compared to the seasons before the COVID pandemic, which is mainly due to the fact that the spread of influenza A this season reached its peak already in December [2022]. The updated diagram can be found via the link.

The number of cases of influenza A and B in Denmark is at the same level in week 10 as in week 9. During week 10, influenza B accounted for 59% of all cases. Hospitalizations continue to decline for both influenza A and B. In Norway, the number of cases of both influenza A and B continued to decline in week 10, but there are geographic differences in influenza activity at the moment. Through week 6, influenza A predominated, followed by a period of even distribution, and since week 9, more cases of influenza B have been reported. Hospital admissions have decreased since week 8.

ECDC/WHO-Europe reports with data up to and including week 9 show that slightly more than half of all reporting countries in Europe had high or medium influenza activity. Both influenza A and B circulate and during week 9 more cases of influenza B (57%) than influenza A were reported in the other surveillance except the sentinel surveillance. Since a few weeks ago, the proportion of influenza B has increased and now dominates in several countries.

Special section: Other causes of respiratory infection
------------------------------------------------------
Voluntary reporting of broad respiratory diagnostics from microbiological laboratories in the region of Kronoberg, Blekinge, Skane, Vastmanland, Orebro, Sormland, Vastra Gotaland and Stockholm provides an overview of other causes of viral respiratory infections, in addition to influenzas A and B, RSV and SARS-CoV-2. Specimens analyzed with broad respiratory diagnostics have in most cases already been tested for influenza, RSV and SARS-CoV-2 and have been negative for these viruses.

This report includes analyzed samples with sampling dates from week 35 2022 through week 10 2023, reported in 4-week periods. Rhino and enteroviruses remain at the same level as in the previous period. For human coronaviruses, an increase from 5 to 9% positive is seen for this period compared to the period week 03-06 2023. Human metapneumoviruses also increase slightly, from 2 to 4% positive. Other viruses remain at low levels. Some regional differences occur.

Human coronaviruses and rhinoviruses and enteroviruses continue to account for the highest percentage of positive samples during the period of week 7-10 2023.

Comments on the statistics on other causes of respiratory tract infection
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rhino and enteroviruses are reported together because both belong to the picornaviridae family and can be difficult to distinguish. In Table S1 and Figure S1, SARS-CoV-2 is not included in the accounting of the occurrence of human coronaviruses. See the weekly reports for COVID-19 instead.

Comments on the statistics
--------------------------
From week 40 2022 until week 20 2023, the enhanced surveillance of influenza is ongoing. The Public Health Agency uses a number of different monitoring systems to monitor the spread of influenza in Sweden during the season. These are described in the weekly report for week 40 2022.

Most samples are analyzed using various multiplex methods that include other agents (including RSV and SARS-CoV-2) and with the broad sampling for COVID-19, it means that significantly more samples are now analyzed for influenza than in the seasons before the pandemic. This means that the number of cases per week is not comparable to levels in seasons prior to 2020-2021.

Confirmed cases are reported per sampling week, alternatively reporting date if sampling date is missing. Statistics on age and gender distribution are based on cases where information on age and legal gender has been received.

Data on deceased confirmed cases includes confirmed influenza cases that died within 30 days after the influenza diagnosis was registered. The analyses mainly focus on data up to 2 weeks ago, as the registry from which the data is taken is updated with some delay.

[As the 1st 2 reports note, India is seeing an uptick in Influenza A cases due to the H3N2 strain. This is in addition to the ongoing circulation of COVID-19 and adenovirus. It would be interesting to see how many of the cases involve co-infections and whether or not co-infections are over-represented in the fatalities that have been observed. As the 2nd piece notes, other co-morbidities continue to be a major factor in mortality just as was noted with adenovirus cases.

The cases of Influenza B in Sweden are also cause for concern given the atypical occurrence of myocarditis or encephalitis. This begs the question if underlying conditions may have been present along with any other co-infections, especially COVID-19 given its link to myocarditis. Based on the later portion of the report it appears most cases are being tested for multiple respiratory pathogens so hopefully additional information can be provided as to the likely cause(s) of the atypical symptoms seen in the young adult cohort. Although uncommon, encephalitis has been seen in this age group in previous case reports (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5548692/>). Myocarditis is typically thought to be rarer with Influenza B than Influenza A, but multiple case reports demonstrate it occurs across age cohorts to include children (<https://journals.lww.com/pidj/fulltext/1997/06000/myocarditis_with_influenza_b_infection.18.aspx> and <https://westjem.com/case-report/fatal-influenza-b-myocarditis-in-a-34-year-old-female.html>). - Mod.JH

An 11-year-old girl is the 1st case of hantavirus [infection] in 2023 in the Los Lagos region
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Health Seremi [Secretaría Regional Ministerial de Salud; regional health ministerial secretariat], confirmed the 1st case of Hantavirus [infection] in 2023 in the Los Lagos region. The victim is an 11-year-old girl from the Río Negro commune.

According to information issued by Radio Bío Bío in Osorno, the minor was infected in the Riachuelo sector.

She is currently in stable condition and is recuperating. 

The Health Seremi, Karin Solís, confirmed this information and called for caution and self-care. ""It is very important to maintain Hantavirus preventive measures, such as those if they are going to use structures or houses that have been closed for a long time, ventilate them for at least 30 minutes. In addition, also keep garbage in closed containers and maintain the cleanliness of houses and shelves where food is kept,"" emphasized the Seremi.

[Apparently the girl has had a somewhat milder infection and, although hospitalized, has not developed the more serious hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome and is recovering. There is no information in the above report about the environmental conditions where the girl became infected nor if there is a search for other cases in the area. Contacts should also be monitored since Andes virus, the hantavirus most like responsible for her disease, can be transmitted to others in close contact with her. 

Hantavirus infections occur in a broad Andean region of Chile every year. Although not specified in this or previous reports from affected regions, the hantavirus involved in this case no doubt is Andes virus, which is endemic in Chile. The patient likely came into contact with areas inhabited by the rodent reservoir of the virus in the region, which is why the Los Lagos regional health Seremi issued warnings about following preventive recommendations in areas of risk where the rodent host of Andes virus is found.

Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly from person to person and only through close physical contact, usually within the family. This is why contacts are warned about possible risk of infection. The commonest source of the infection is the long-tailed pygmy rice rat. Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg>. - Mod.TY

""It is very important to maintain Hantavirus preventive measures, such as those if they are going to use structures or houses that have been closed for a long time, ventilate them for at least 30 minutes. In addition, also keep garbage in closed containers and maintain the cleanliness of houses and shelves where food is kept,"" emphasized the Seremi.[Byline: Manuel Stuardo]--Communicated by:ProMED[Apparently the girl has had a somewhat milder infection and, although hospitalized, has not developed the more serious hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome and is recovering. There is no information in the above report about the environmental conditions where the girl became infected nor if there is a search for other cases in the area. Contacts should also be monitored since Andes virus, the hantavirus most like responsible for her disease, can be transmitted to others in close contact with her. Hantavirus infections occur in a broad Andean region of Chile every year. Although not specified in this or previous reports from affected regions, the hantavirus involved in this case no doubt is Andes virus, which is endemic in Chile. The patient likely came into contact with areas inhabited by the rodent reservoir of the virus in the region, which is why the Los Lagos regional health Seremi issued warnings about following preventive recommendations in areas of risk where the rodent host of Andes virus is found.Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly from person to person and only through close physical contact, usually within the family. This is why contacts are warned about possible risk of infection. The commonest source of the infection is the long-tailed pygmy rice rat. Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg>. - Mod.TYProMED map:Chile: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8709023,7>]",Bio Bio Chile,,

""Sheep pox and goat pox are viral diseases of sheep and goats characterised by fever, generalised papules or nodules, vesicles (rarely), internal lesions (particularly in the lungs), and death. Both diseases are caused by strains of capripoxvirus, all of which can infect sheep and goats. Although most of the strains examined cause more severe clinical disease in either sheep or goats, some strains have been isolated that are equally pathogenic in both species.""

""Sheep pox and goat pox are endemic in Africa north of the Equator, the Middle East, and Asia, while some parts of Europe have experienced outbreaks recently. Countries that reported outbreaks of the disease between 2010 and 2015 include Bulgaria, Chinese Taipei, Israel, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Morocco, Greece, and Russia, with Greece, Israel, and Russia having experienced recurring incidences.""

Summary
Report type: Follow-up 2, final
Started: 26 Jan 2023
Confirmed: 2 Feb 2023
Report date: 9 Mar 2023
End date: 6 Mar 2023
Causal agent: Foot-and-mouth disease virus
Serotype: SAT 2
Nature of diagnosis: Clinical, laboratory test
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

Outbreak location: Dhlail, Zarqa, Zarqa
Quantitative data summary (total):
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered for use / Vaccinated
Cattle / 13 400 / 10 963 / 379 / 0 / 0 / 73 000

Affected population description:
The affected population is the cattle farms in Dhlail area in Zarqa Governorate with severe clinical signs shown on dairy cattle: fever, lesions on mouth, hooves and udder with a significant reduction in milk yield and deaths of calves.

Epidemiology:
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: All cattle in the outbreak zone were vaccinated with a booster dose of an FMD vaccine containing inactivated SAT-2 Eritrea serotype. Since last follow-up report no new cases were detected in the infected zone or outside the infected zone (the buffer zone). Surveillance in the buffer zone and surveillance zone revealed no positive animals using the NSP ELISA.

Control measures at event level
Applied in domestic animals: Quarantine, traceability, surveillance outside the restricted zone, vaccination in response to the outbreak(s), movement control, disinfection

[According to Jordan's final report, the FMD serotype SAT-2 event, which started in January 2023, has been resolved, after severely affecting the cluster of dairy cattle in Dhlail. Remaining restricted to a single district is remarkable. Such scenario could have been achieved by the timely application of animal movement restrictions, closure of animal markets, and ring vaccination around the focus, with a matching vaccine. Another scenario, namely subclinical infections by FMD SAT-2 virus in resistant livestock elsewhere in Jordan, deserves to be examined by a serosurvey in indigenous, possibly resistant cattle, sheep, and goats.
 
Currently, FMDV SAT-2 is continuing its circulation in the region, reportedly in Turkey and Iraq. It will be interesting to compare, in these 2 countries, FMDV strains SAT-2 and (endemic) O strains in regard to their respective pathogenicity, particularly in juvenile ruminants.

Genotyping results of the causative agents in the 3 affected countries are anticipated. - Mod.AS

An Atlantic titi monkey [_Callicebus personatus_] found dead in Águas da Prata (Sao Paulo) tested positive for yellow fever, according to a statement from the prefecture released on social media this Friday [17 Mar 2023].

The animal's body was found by a resident in the rural area of municipality, in the district of São Roque da Fartura, on 24 Feb 2023. In January [2023], Vargem Grande do Sul, which is near the district, confirmed the 1st case of yellow fever in the State of São Paulo since 2020. The 73-year-old has recovered from his illness.

According to the city government, biological samples were collected from the animal by the Zoonoses Service of the municipality for laboratory diagnosis by the Adolfo Lutz Institute in São Paulo, confirming the disease.

Since the case registered in Vargem Grande do Sul, the Secretary of Health of Águas da Prata, through the Epidemiological Surveillance, already intensified vaccination for all residents of the rural area of the municipality.

[The distance between Águas da Prata, where yellow fever is now confirmed in non-human primates, and Vargem Grande do Sul, where in January 2023 a human case of the disease was confirmed (see PRO/PORT Yellow fever - Brazil (SP), human, information preliminary, official (?), awaiting further information <http://promedmail.org/post/20230126.8707990>), is 20 km (12 mi) in a straight line.

The distance between Vargem Grande do Sul and Monte Santo de Minas (Minas Gerais) where a human case of yellow fever was also confirmed (see PRO/PORT Yellow fever - Brazil (05) (MG), human, death confirmed <http://promedmail.org/post/20230315.8708943>) is 71 km (44 mi) in a straight line.

These were definitely not isolated transmissions, but an ecoepidemiological scenario with evident enhancement/amplification of yellow fever virus circulation over an area probably much more extensive and potentially with great possibility of expansion north-south and east-west in the territory of the state of São Paulo, as we had warned in a previous comment in post (PRO/PORT Yellow fever - Brazil (05): (MG) human, death confirmed <http://promedmail.org/post/20230315.8708943>). At the end of 2022, ProMED-PORT reported the occurrence of yellow fever epizootics in non-human primates in the state of Minas Gerais (see PRO/PORT Yellow fever - Brazil (04) (MG), primate non-human, confirmed <http://promedmail.org/post/20221231.8707530>). In August 2022, a human case was confirmed also in Minas Gerais (PRO/PORT Yellow fever - Brazil (02) (MG), confirmed case <http://promedmail.org/post/20220803.8704838>). The circulation of the virus was already taking place. This now confirms 1st case (fatal) of yellow fever in 2023 in the state. It is quite plausible that new epizootics in non-human primates will be observed and, depending on the number of people still susceptible, it will come as no surprise that new human cases will occur in Minas Gerais and, eventually, neighboring states.

In this context, more robust action should be adopted and coordinated at not just the local/regional level, but state. [This should include:]

- Risk communication to the population
- Intensification of vaccination, with an effective active search for non-immunized individuals
- Training of health professionals for suspicion, investigation and clinical management of suspected cases
- Active search for suspected human cases, including those with less severe febrile conditions (often confused with the currently very common dengue and leptospirosis)
- Intensified surveillance of epizootics and population monitoring of non-human primate populations
- Entomological research actions and, eventually, measures of vector control in peri-urban areas. - Mod.RNA [in Portuguese, trans. Mod.TY]

Although the occurrence of a single case in a non-human primate may not seem significant, it is a clear indication that yellow fever virus is circulating in the area in the sylvan (forest) transmission cycle. There is the risk that a person who becomes infected could carry the virus to urban or periurban localities where the vector of the urban transmission cycle, _Aedes aegypti_, is abundant. Should there be unvaccinated people in that circumstance, the risk of initiation of an outbreak is possible. That is why a prompt, coordinated response by heath authorities at all levels as noted by Mod.RNA, coupled with an increase in vaccination coverage as noted in the report above, is essential to prevent spread of the disease. - Mod.TY

.................................................rna/ty/rd/lxl","An Atlantic titi monkey [_Callicebus personatus_] found dead in Águas da Prata (Sao Paulo) tested positive for yellow fever, according to a statement from the prefecture released on social media this Friday [17 Mar 2023].The animal's body was found by a resident in the rural area of municipality, in the district of São Roque da Fartura, on 24 Feb 2023. In January [2023], Vargem Grande do Sul, which is near the district, confirmed the 1st case of yellow fever in the State of São Paulo since 2020. The 73-year-old has recovered from his illness.According to the city government, biological samples were collected from the animal by the Zoonoses Service of the municipality for laboratory diagnosis by the Adolfo Lutz Institute in São Paulo, confirming the disease.Since the case registered in Vargem Grande do Sul, the Secretary of Health of Águas da Prata, through the Epidemiological Surveillance, already intensified vaccination for all residents of the rural area of the municipality.--Communicated by:ProMEDviaProMED-PORT[The distance between Águas da Prata, where yellow fever is now confirmed in non-human primates, and Vargem Grande do Sul, where in January 2023 a human case of the disease was confirmed (see PRO/PORT Yellow fever - Brazil (SP), human, information preliminary, official (?), awaiting further information <http://promedmail.org/post/20230126.8707990>), is 20 km (12 mi) in a straight line.The distance between Vargem Grande do Sul and Monte Santo de Minas (Minas Gerais) where a human case of yellow fever was also confirmed (see PRO/PORT Yellow fever - Brazil (05) (MG), human, death confirmed <http://promedmail.org/post/20230315.8708943>) is 71 km (44 mi) in a straight line.These were definitely not isolated transmissions, but an ecoepidemiological scenario with evident enhancement/amplification of yellow fever virus circulation over an area probably much more extensive and potentially with great possibility of expansion north-south and east-west in the territory of the state of São Paulo, as we had warned in a previous comment in post (PRO/PORT Yellow fever - Brazil (05): (MG) human, death confirmed <http://promedmail.org/post/20230315.8708943>). At the end of 2022, ProMED-PORT reported the occurrence of yellow fever epizootics in non-human primates in the state of Minas Gerais (see PRO/PORT Yellow fever - Brazil (04) (MG), primate non-human, confirmed <http://promedmail.org/post/20221231.8707530>). In August 2022, a human case was confirmed also in Minas Gerais (PRO/PORT Yellow fever - Brazil (02) (MG), confirmed case <http://promedmail.org/post/20220803.8704838>). The circulation of the virus was already taking place. This now confirms 1st case (fatal) of yellow fever in 2023 in the state. It is quite plausible that new epizootics in non-human primates will be observed and, depending on the number of people still susceptible, it will come as no surprise that new human cases will occur in Minas Gerais and, eventually, neighboring states.In this context, more robust action should be adopted and coordinated at not just the local/regional level, but state. [This should include:]- Risk communication to the population- Intensification of vaccination, with an effective active search for non-immunized individuals- Training of health professionals for suspicion, investigation and clinical management of suspected cases- Active search for suspected human cases, including those with less severe febrile conditions (often confused with the currently very common dengue and leptospirosis)- Intensified surveillance of epizootics and population monitoring of non-human primate populations- Entomological research actions and, eventually, measures of vector control in peri-urban areas. - Mod.RNA [in Portuguese, trans. Mod.TY]Although the occurrence of a single case in a non-human primate may not seem significant, it is a clear indication that yellow fever virus is circulating in the area in the sylvan (forest) transmission cycle. There is the risk that a person who becomes infected could carry the virus to urban or periurban localities where the vector of the urban transmission cycle, _Aedes aegypti_, is abundant. Should there be unvaccinated people in that circumstance, the risk of initiation of an outbreak is possible. That is why a prompt, coordinated response by heath authorities at all levels as noted by Mod.RNA, coupled with an increase in vaccination coverage as noted in the report above, is essential to prevent spread of the disease. - Mod.TYProMED map:Sao Paulo, Brazil: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8709020,45784>]",G1,,

Outbreak of hepatitis A virus infections linked to frozen organic strawberries
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reported cases: 5
States: 1
Hospitalizations: 2
Deaths: 0

Investigation details
---------------------
CDC, state public health and regulatory officials, and the FDA are investigating an outbreak of hepatitis A linked to frozen organic strawberries imported from certain farms located in Baja California, Mexico, by a common supplier. Frozen organic strawberries may be sold to a variety of retailers under multiple brand labels. Traceback and epidemiological investigations show that people with outbreak-associated cases in Washington purchased the same retail brand of frozen organic strawberries prior to becoming ill.

As of 13 Mar 2023, a total of 5 outbreak-associated cases of hepatitis A have been reported from one state.

Illnesses started on dates ranging from 24 Nov 2022 to 27 Dec 2022. Ill people range in age from 38 to 61 years, with a median age of 52 years; 40% of ill people are female. Of 5 people with available information, 2 (40%) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
Epidemiologic and traceback evidence indicate that frozen organic strawberries, imported fresh from certain farms located in Baja California, Mexico in 2022, are the likely source of this outbreak. The hepatitis A virus strain causing illnesses in this outbreak is genetically identical to the strain that caused a foodborne hepatitis A outbreak in 2022, which was linked to fresh organic strawberries imported from Baja California, Mexico, and sold at various retailers.

In interviews, ill people answered questions about the foods they ate and other exposures in the 2 to 7 weeks before they became ill. Of people who were interviewed, all of them reported eating frozen organic strawberries. This proportion was significantly higher than results from a survey of healthy people in which 24% reported eating frozen berries in the week before they were interviewed.

In response to this investigation, California Splendor, Inc. of San Diego, California voluntarily recalled certain lots of 4-lb. bags of Kirkland Signature Frozen Organic Whole Strawberries that were sold at Costco stores in Los Angeles, California; Hawaii; and 2 San Diego, California business centers. The lots subject to this recall include 140962-08, 142222-23, 142792-54, 142862-57, 142912-59, 142162-20, 142202-21, 142782-53, 142852-56, 142902-58, 142212-22, 142232-24, 142842-55.

In response to this investigation, Scenic Fruit Company of Gresham, Oregon voluntarily recalled frozen organic strawberries, sold to Costco, Trader Joe's, Aldi, KeHE, Vital Choice Seafood, and PCC Community Markets in certain states.

[The previously reported outbreak of the genetically identical virus in 2022 involved 17 American cases and 10 Canadian cases.

The best way to prevent hepatitis A is by getting vaccinated. The hepatitis A vaccine became available in 1995 and is recommended as part of the routine childhood vaccination schedule. However, many adults have not been vaccinated and may be susceptible to the hepatitis A virus.

Two doses of hepatitis A vaccine are routinely recommended for:
- All children (1st dose of vaccine between 12 months and 23 months of age, and the 2nd dose 6 to 18 months later)
- Travelers to countries that have higher rates of hepatitis A (high-risk areas include parts of Africa and Asia, and moderate risk areas include Central and South America, Eastern Europe, and parts of Asia)
- Men who have sex with men
- Users of injection and non-injection illegal drugs
- People experiencing homelessness
- Household or sexual contacts of hepatitis A patients
- People with chronic liver diseases, such as cirrhosis, hepatitis B or hepatitis C
- Family members or caregivers of a recent adoptee from countries where hepatitis A is common
- People who are treated with clotting-factor concentrates

New Caledonia health officials report a rise in leptospirosis cases since the beginning of the year [2023]. As of 28 Feb 2023, 65 leptospirosis cases have been confirmed. This includes 25 cases in January [2023] and 40 cases in February [2023]. There were in total 56 hospitalizations (86%) and one death recorded since the beginning of the year. The cases have been spread over 20 municipalities in both the southern and northern provinces.

New Caledonia reported 265 confirmed cases of leptospirosis in 2022. Among them, 227 people (85.6%) were hospitalized and 4 deaths were recorded (1.1%). In 2021, 229 cases of leptospirosis were declared. Among them, 178 people (77.7%) were hospitalized and 4 deaths were recorded (1.7%).

Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease. People (and animals) can get infected when they are exposed to the urine of infected animals. They can also get infected from water, soil, or food contaminated with infected animal urine. Leptospirosis bacteria can enter the body through skin or mucous membranes (eyes, nose, or mouth).

To reduce your individual risk, it is important to understand that exposure to animals, soil, mud, and floodwaters during work or recreational activities increases your risk of infection.

Symptoms include fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, vomiting, stomach pain, diarrhea, jaundice (yellow eyes and skin), red eyes, and skin rash. Without treatment, leptospirosis can lead to kidney damage, meningitis (inflammation of the membrane around the brain and spinal cord), liver failure, respiratory distress, and even death.

[New Caledonia (pop., 271 407 in 2019), a French overseas territory, is an archipelago located east of Australia, north of New Zealand, south of the Equator, and just west of Fiji and Vanuatu; it includes the main island of Grande Terre, the Loyalty Islands, and smaller islands and is divided into 3 provinces -- the North and South Provinces are on the main island, while the Loyalty Islands Province is a series of islands east of the main island (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Caledonia>).

Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that occurs worldwide and is transmitted to humans by exposure to soil or freshwater contaminated with the urine of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rodents) that are chronically infected with pathogenic _Leptospira_. _Leptospira_ may survive in contaminated freshwater or moist soil for weeks to months. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers.

New Caledonia's wet season is November to April, when heavy rain may be frequent. For example, heavy rainfall is forecast across New Caledonia through at least 17 Mar 2023 (<https://crisis24.garda.com/alerts/2023/03/new-caledonia-adverse-weather-forecast-territory-wide-through-at-least-march-17>), but there has been notification of extensive flooding in news reports online so far this year. - Mod.ML

An alarming outbreak of extensively drug-resistant bacteria linked to eye drops has now sickened 68 people across 16 states, according to the latest update from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [<https://www.cdc.gov/hai/outbreaks/CRPA-artificial-tears.html>]. At least 16 people have been hospitalized, 8 have lost vision, and 4 have had their eyeballs surgically removed (enucleation). One person has died, which was reported earlier.

The agency first released a health alert on the outbreak on 1 Feb 2023. At that point, the outbreak had sickened 55 people in 12 states, with the one death reported in a Washington patient. In an update emailed to Ars on 22 Feb 2023, the CDC said the case count had reached 58, with 5 cases of vision loss and one enucleation.

The continued rise in cases and severe outcomes highlights the challenge of fighting the germ behind the outbreak, which is an extensively drug-resistant form of _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_. It has the unwieldy name of Verona Integron-mediated Metallo-β-lactamase (VIM) and Guiana-Extended Spectrum-β-Lactamase (GES)-producing carbapenem-resistant _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ -- or VIM-GES-CRPA, for short.

The VIM-GES-CRPA outbreak strain is rare and has never been seen in the US before. Health officials think it was brought into the country in contaminated eye drops manufactured by Global Pharma, a Chennai, India-based manufacturer. The products were sold under the brand names EzriCare Artificial Tears and Delsam Pharma's Artificial Eye Ointment, which were available nationwide via Amazon, Walmart, and other retailers.

Both products have been recalled, and the Food and Drug Administration put out separate warnings for consumers to immediately stop using the products. The agency noted that Global Pharma has had multiple manufacturing violations, including ""lack of appropriate microbial testing, formulation issues (the company manufactures and distributes ophthalmic drugs in 
multi-use bottles, without an adequate preservative), and lack of proper controls concerning tamper-evident packaging.""

VIM-GES-CRPA can be difficult to shake even if the eye drops are quickly ditched. The bacteria can lie low, sometimes spreading stealthily, which is particularly problematic in health care facilities with vulnerable patients. Of the 68 cases so far, 37 are linked to clusters in 4 health care facilities.

""Patients can carry these organisms on or in their body without showing signs of illness -- this is called asymptomatic colonization,"" Marissa Grossman, a CDC Epidemic Intelligence Service Officer, told Ars last month [February 2023]. ""This attribute helps facilitate their silent spread in health care facilities."" Once a case is found in a health care facility, the CDC and other health officials recommend screening patients to find silent carriers, which is how some of the cases in the current outbreak were found, Grossman said. Most of the health care-linked cases had exposure to the eye drops, but some did not, suggesting person-to-person transmission, she said.

Antibiotic sensitivity testing suggests at least one newer antibiotic is still effective at treating the VIM-GES-CRPA strain. But Grossman noted that the germ's widespread distribution in the US via the eye drops is ""concerning.""

""To-date, extensively drug-resistant _Pseudomonas_ with genes that rapidly spread resistance, like VIM and GES, have been rare in this country, and typically associated with person-to-person spread in health care facilities,"" she said. ""The widespread introduction of the outbreak strain, which has not been seen before in the US, threatens to undermine efforts to prevent these highly resistant organisms from becoming more common.""

Anyone who has used the recalled eye drops and has signs of an eye infection should seek medical care immediately. But, Grossman adds that ""at this time, there is no recommendation for testing of patients who have used this product and who are not experiencing any signs or symptoms of infection.""

This month [March 2023], the FDA posted recall notices for 2 other types of eye drops -- from Pharmedica and Apotex -- for non-sterility concerns, but they have not been linked to the VIM-GES-CRPA outbreak.

""Current Update
---------------
""As of 14 Mar 2023, CDC, in partnership with state and local health departments, identified 68 patients in 16 states (CA, CO, CT, FL, IL, NC, NJ, NM, NY, NV, PA, SD, TX, UT, WA, WI) with VIM-GES-CRPA, a rare strain of extensively drug-resistant _P. aeruginosa_. Thirty-seven patients were linked to 4 healthcare facility clusters. One person has died and there have been 8 reports of vision loss and 4 reports of enucleation (surgical removal of eyeball). Dates of specimen collection were from May 2022 to February 2023. Isolates have been identified from clinical cultures of sputum or bronchial wash (15), cornea (17), urine (10), other nonsterile sources (4), and blood (2), and from rectal swabs (26) collected for surveillance; some patients had specimens collected from more than one anatomic site.

""Most patients reported using artificial tears. Patients reported over 10 different brands of artificial tears and some patients used multiple brands. EzriCare Artificial Tears, a preservative-free, over-the-counter product packaged in multidose bottles, was the brand most commonly reported. This was the only common artificial tears product identified across the 4 healthcare facility clusters. Laboratory testing by CDC identified the presence of VIM-GES-CRPA in opened EzriCare bottles from multiple lots; these bottles were collected from patients with and without eye infections and from 2 states. VIM-GES-CRPA recovered from opened products match the outbreak strain. Testing of unopened bottles of EzriCare Artificial Tears is ongoing to assist in evaluating for whether contamination may have occurred during manufacturing. Patients and healthcare providers should immediately stop the use of EzriCare Artificial Tears pending additional information and guidance from CDC and FDA.""

""The infections are caused by a strain of carbapenem-resistant _P. aeruginosa_ that produces the Verona integron-encoded metallo-β-lactamase (VIM) and the Guiana-Extended Spectrum-β-Lactamase (GES). Isolates are _P. aeruginosa_ sequence type (ST) 1203 and harbor blaVIM-80 and blaGES-9, a combination not previously identified in the United States.

""VIM-GES-CRPA isolates associated with this outbreak have been extensively drug-resistant (XDR). Isolates that underwent testing at public health laboratories were not susceptible to cefepime, ceftazidime, piperacillin-tazobactam, aztreonam, carbapenems, ceftazidime-avibactam, ceftolozane-tazobactam, fluoroquinolones, polymyxins, amikacin, gentamicin, and tobramycin. A subset of 3 isolates that underwent antimicrobial susceptibility testing for cefiderocol were susceptible to this agent.

""Carbapenem-resistance mechanism testing for carbapenem-resistant _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ and expanded antimicrobial susceptibility testing for clinical decision making is available through the Antibiotic Resistance Laboratory Network [<https://bit.ly/4083VNM>] which can be accessed through state health department healthcare-associated infections programs [<https://bit.ly/3YWuRPx>].""

The full CDC report is available at the source URL.

_Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, a Gram-negative bacillary pathogen, is a frequent cause of healthcare-associated infections, such as pneumonia, urinary tract, and bloodstream infections. In 2017, multidrug-resistant _P. aeruginosa_ caused an estimated 32 600 infections in hospitalized patients and 2700 estimated deaths in the United States (<https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/pdf/threats-report/pseudomonas-aeruginosa-508.pdf>).

Outbreaks of _P. aeruginosa_ in healthcare facilities are often caused by multidrug-resistant _P. aeruginosa_ clones that colonize the hospital environment and patients and routes of transmission may be patient-to-patient or hospital environment-to-patient, via contaminated hands of hospital staff or equipment (<https://aricjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13756-016-0157-9>, <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19046054>, <https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/JCM.03071-12>, <https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/JCM.01772-06>, and <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4219028/>).

Carbapenem resistance can be due to multiple mechanisms that include increased expression of antibiotic efflux pumps, decreased outer membrane permeability due to reduced expression of transmembrane porin channels, and increased AmpC beta-lactamase activity, in addition to the acquisition of plasmid- or chromosomal-encoded carbapenemases (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2620637/> and <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7930500/>). 

The carbapenem-resistant _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ (VIM-GES-CRPA) outbreak strain in the CDC alert above has been shown to produce Verona integron-encoded metallo-beta-lactamase (VIM) that inactivates carbapenem antibiotics. Other metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) include NDMs (New Delhi MBLs) and IMPs (imipenemases). All MBLs are Ambler class B beta-lactamases, which have 1 or 2 divalent zinc ions at the active site, rather than serine. MBLs hydrolyze almost all beta-lactam antibiotics (including carbapenems), except aztreonam, the monobactam antibiotic, and cefiderocol, a siderophore-modified cephalosporin active against carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Aztreonam, the only monobactam currently in clinical use, is an anti-pseudomonal antibiotic and is not hydrolyzed by MBLs owing to poor, nonproductive binding with the enzymes (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7428391/>).

However, some MBL producers are also resistant to aztreonam due to co-production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) that destroy aztreonam. The CRPA outbreak strain co-produces the ESBL Guiana-Extended Spectrum-beta-lactamase (GES). This GES ESBL likely accounts for the CRPA outbreak strain's resistance to aztreonam.

The older beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitors (BLIs), such as clavulanic acid, sulbactam, and tazobactam do not inhibit MBLs, nor do the newer non-beta-lactam BLIs that include avibactam and relebactam, which have a diazabicyclooctane core, and vaborbactam, which has boronic acid core. However, avibactam should block GES, allowing aztreonam to exert its bactericidal effects against the VIM-, GES-producing CRPA outbreak strain. 

Avibactam is currently marketed with ceftazidime, an anti-_P. aeruginosa_ extended-spectrum cephalosporin, and if tested in combination with aztreonam, may have antimicrobial activity against the VIM-GES-CRPA outbreak strain (<https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/73/2/542/4641705>). The combination of avibactam and aztreonam is currently under clinical development (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8388901/>). 

Among those who used the eye solution contaminated with the VIM-GES-CRPA outbreak strain, only 20% of the infections with this strain involved the eye; the other CRPA infections due to the outbreak strain in users involved sites other than the eye (bloodstream, and respiratory, GI and urinary tracts), suggesting the VIM-GES-CRPA applied to the eye can subsequently colonize and/or infect many other sites in users. In addition, we learned that, although the VIM-GES-CRPA outbreak strain had never been seen in the USA before, some of those infected with this XDR outbreak strain had never been exposed to the contaminated eye drops, suggesting person-to-person transmission. - Mod.ML

.................................................sb/ml/may/lxl","An alarming outbreak of extensively drug-resistant bacteria linked to eye drops has now sickened 68 people across 16 states, according to the latest update from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [<https://www.cdc.gov/hai/outbreaks/CRPA-artificial-tears.html>]. At least 16 people have been hospitalized, 8 have lost vision, and 4 have had their eyeballs surgically removed (enucleation). One person has died, which was reported earlier.The agency first released a health alert on the outbreak on 1 Feb 2023. At that point, the outbreak had sickened 55 people in 12 states, with the one death reported in a Washington patient. In an update emailed to Ars on 22 Feb 2023, the CDC said the case count had reached 58, with 5 cases of vision loss and one enucleation.The continued rise in cases and severe outcomes highlights the challenge of fighting the germ behind the outbreak, which is an extensively drug-resistant form of _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_. It has the unwieldy name of Verona Integron-mediated Metallo-β-lactamase (VIM) and Guiana-Extended Spectrum-β-Lactamase (GES)-producing carbapenem-resistant _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ -- or VIM-GES-CRPA, for short.The VIM-GES-CRPA outbreak strain is rare and has never been seen in the US before. Health officials think it was brought into the country in contaminated eye drops manufactured by Global Pharma, a Chennai, India-based manufacturer. The products were sold under the brand names EzriCare Artificial Tears and Delsam Pharma's Artificial Eye Ointment, which were available nationwide via Amazon, Walmart, and other retailers.Both products have been recalled, and the Food and Drug Administration put out separate warnings for consumers to immediately stop using the products. The agency noted that Global Pharma has had multiple manufacturing violations, including ""lack of appropriate microbial testing, formulation issues (the company manufactures and distributes ophthalmic drugs in multi-use bottles, without an adequate preservative), and lack of proper controls concerning tamper-evident packaging.""VIM-GES-CRPA can be difficult to shake even if the eye drops are quickly ditched. The bacteria can lie low, sometimes spreading stealthily, which is particularly problematic in health care facilities with vulnerable patients. Of the 68 cases so far, 37 are linked to clusters in 4 health care facilities.""Patients can carry these organisms on or in their body without showing signs of illness -- this is called asymptomatic colonization,"" Marissa Grossman, a CDC Epidemic Intelligence Service Officer, told Ars last month [February 2023]. ""This attribute helps facilitate their silent spread in health care facilities."" Once a case is found in a health care facility, the CDC and other health officials recommend screening patients to find silent carriers, which is how some of the cases in the current outbreak were found, Grossman said. Most of the health care-linked cases had exposure to the eye drops, but some did not, suggesting person-to-person transmission, she said.Antibiotic sensitivity testing suggests at least one newer antibiotic is still effective at treating the VIM-GES-CRPA strain. But Grossman noted that the germ's widespread distribution in the US via the eye drops is ""concerning.""""To-date, extensively drug-resistant _Pseudomonas_ with genes that rapidly spread resistance, like VIM and GES, have been rare in this country, and typically associated with person-to-person spread in health care facilities,"" she said. ""The widespread introduction of the outbreak strain, which has not been seen before in the US, threatens to undermine efforts to prevent these highly resistant organisms from becoming more common.""Anyone who has used the recalled eye drops and has signs of an eye infection should seek medical care immediately. But, Grossman adds that ""at this time, there is no recommendation for testing of patients who have used this product and who are not experiencing any signs or symptoms of infection.""This month [March 2023], the FDA posted recall notices for 2 other types of eye drops -- from Pharmedica and Apotex -- for non-sterility concerns, but they have not been linked to the VIM-GES-CRPA outbreak.[Byline: Beth Mole]--Communicated by:ProMED[The citation for the CDC Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAIs) report entitled ""Outbreak of Extensively Drug-resistant _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ Associated with Artificial Tears"", and the ""Current Update"", and ""Investigative summary & strain information for clinicians, laboratory scientists, and public health officials"" extracted from this report follow below:Citation: CDC Healthcare-associated Infections (HAI).

""Outbreak of Extensively Drug-resistant _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ Associated with Artificial Tears"" <https://www.cdc.gov/hai/outbreaks/CRPA-artificial-tears.html>.""Current Update---------------""As of 14 Mar 2023, CDC, in partnership with state and local health departments, identified 68 patients in 16 states (CA, CO, CT, FL, IL, NC, NJ, NM, NY, NV, PA, SD, TX, UT, WA, WI) with VIM-GES-CRPA, a rare strain of extensively drug-resistant _P. aeruginosa_. Thirty-seven patients were linked to 4 healthcare facility clusters. One person has died and there have been 8 reports of vision loss and 4 reports of enucleation (surgical removal of eyeball). Dates of specimen collection were from May 2022 to February 2023. Isolates have been identified from clinical cultures of sputum or bronchial wash (15), cornea (17), urine (10), other nonsterile sources (4), and blood (2), and from rectal swabs (26) collected for surveillance; some patients had specimens collected from more than one anatomic site.""Most patients reported using artificial tears. Patients reported over 10 different brands of artificial tears and some patients used multiple brands. EzriCare Artificial Tears, a preservative-free, over-the-counter product packaged in multidose bottles, was the brand most commonly reported. This was the only common artificial tears product identified across the 4 healthcare facility clusters. Laboratory testing by CDC identified the presence of VIM-GES-CRPA in opened EzriCare bottles from multiple lots; these bottles were collected from patients with and without eye infections and from 2 states. VIM-GES-CRPA recovered from opened products match the outbreak strain. Testing of unopened bottles of EzriCare Artificial Tears is ongoing to assist in evaluating for whether contamination may have occurred during manufacturing. Patients and healthcare providers should immediately stop the use of EzriCare Artificial Tears pending additional information and guidance from CDC and FDA.""""Investigative summary & strain information for clinicians, laboratory scientists, and public health officials:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------""The infections are caused by a strain of carbapenem-resistant _P. aeruginosa_ that produces the Verona integron-encoded metallo-β-lactamase (VIM) and the Guiana-Extended Spectrum-β-Lactamase (GES).

Information About the SAT-2 Virus
---------------------------------
Upon the emergence of developments related to foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] in Iraq, samples from different locations were sent to our Ministry's Foot and Mouth Institute [Alum, Ankara] Directorate within the framework of the Sample Sending and Testing Protocol under the coordination of the European Union Commission for Combating Foot and Mouth Disease (EuFMD).

Our institute determined that a sample was serotype SAT-2, which has not been found in our country before. The agent was isolated and studies were immediately started for the production of a vaccine against this serotype in our country. All stakeholders, as well as our Provincial Directorates, were warned about the issue.

In order to prevent the spread of the disease to our country, our Ministry immediately contacted the relevant institutions and provided necessary information on increasing border surveillance and road control activities.

As a result of meticulous work in the field, the 1st case with FMDV serotype SAT-2 was identified. All measures, including cordon-quarantine, have been taken in 8 enterprises that are currently infected. On 8 Mar 2023, the necessary notification was made to the World Animal Health Organization [WOAH].

As a result of the studies carried out by our Alum Institute Directorate, a vaccine against the SAT-2 serotype was produced and made ready for use as of 9 Mar 2023.

All measures to prevent the spread of the disease were taken by the National Center for Disease Control, which was deployed upon these developments, and all movements (in and out of the province) of animals susceptible to FMD were stopped throughout the country during the spring FMD vaccination campaign, except for consignments for slaughter, import and export purposes.

All developments regarding FMDV SAT-2 were closely followed by our Ministry from the start and all necessary precautions have been taken. Our Ministry, which has completed the production of vaccine against this serotype, which is seen for the 1st time in our country, is rapidly carrying out the necessary studies for the vaccination of our entire cattle stock. 

A total of 2.5 million doses of a tetravalent FMD vaccine, containing SAT-2, produced by our FMD Institute Directorate, have been shipped to the field. Our Institute Directorate continues to produce vaccines containing SAT-2, aiming to complete the dispatch process to all provincial directorates of agriculture as soon as possible .

[While some information included in the above press release was published by Turkey's Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry on 9 Mar 2023 and cited by the local media (see 20230310.8708855), the vaccine production details are new and encouraging. It may be assumed that the release of the vaccine's 1st batch ""to the field"" is indicative of its safety having already been tested, and its efficacy tested as well or yet under study. Turkey's livestock statistics (2022 data) are -- roughly -- 17 million cattle, 45 million sheep, and 12 million goats. 

The Ministry's ""Foot and Mouth Disease in Turkey"" review is available at <https://vetkontrol.tarimorman.gov.tr/sap/Menu/34/Turkiyede-Sap-Hastaligi>. It includes information on the FMD vaccination policy, coordinated with and supported by FAO/EuFMD, as applied in Turkey since 1962, when FMDV serotype SAT-1 spread from Bahrain to the Mesopotamian region, the Middle East and Anatolia. The policy has undergone changes since then, according to epidemiological considerations and international OIE/WOAH animal health requirements. Initially, Thrace was declared a (vaccinated) buffer zone. Later, western and eastern buffer zones were established, to prevent, respectively, FMD spread westwards to the Balkan and its introduction from Middle East countries. A trivalent vaccine (serotypes A, O, and Asia1) was applied in the buffer zones. Thrace was the only region maintaining, most of the time, FMD freedom. This situation is currently under threat from FMDV SAT-2. As indicated in the above press release, FMDV SAT-2 has now been added to the (killed) vaccine produced by the Alum Institute in Ankara, becoming tetravalent. 

Ramadan is expected to begin this year on 22 Mar 2023, ending 20 Apr 2023. Intensified animal movements are expected preceding and during Ramadan. A large proportion of domestic ruminants will probably remain unvaccinated against the exotic SAT-2 strain. This is the background to the very severe measures undertaken by the Turkish authorities, including closing of animal markets and standstill. - Mod.AS

[3] USA: serial interval and incubation period estimates of mpox

Citation: Madewell ZJ, Charniga K, Masters NB, et al. Serial interval and incubation period estimates of monkeypox virus infection in 12 jurisdictions, United States, May-August 2022. Emerg Infect Dis. 2023.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The serial interval is defined as the time between symptom onset in a primary case-patient and symptom onset in the secondary case-patient and depends on the incubation period (the time from a person's infection to the onset of signs and symptoms), epidemic phase, and population contact patterns. The serial interval is critical for estimating the effective reproduction number (Rt) and forecasting incidence, both of which are important for understanding the course of an outbreak and the effect of interventions (e.g., antiviral drugs and vaccines). In the current outbreak, many patients report multiple anonymous sex partners or attendance at large events, such as festivals, in the 3 weeks before symptom onset, which has complicated efforts to identify primary and secondary case pairs. By using preliminary data from 17 mpox case pairs in the United Kingdom, researchers estimated the mean serial interval to be 9.8 days with high uncertainty (95% credible interval [CrI] 5.9-21.4 days). An investigation of 16 primary and secondary case pairs in Italy indicated the estimated mean generation time, or time between infection of primary and secondary cases, to be 12.5 (95% CrI 7.5-17.3) days. In this report, we estimate the serial interval and incubation period for symptom onset and rash onset for MPXV infection in the United States.

The Study
---------
Data on self-reported symptom and rash onset dates for primary and secondary case pairs, including the type of contact that occurred between pairs, were compiled by 12 state and local health departments. We examined serial interval for both earliest symptom onset and rash onset because the latter may be more specific to mpox than the other signs. Earliest symptom onset included any mpox symptom as defined by CDC, including rash. We only included cases if there was a high degree of certainty that the secondary case-patient was infected by the primary case-patient (Appendix).

Conclusions
-----------
Determining the serial interval of a pathogen can inform our understanding of the timing of transmission relative to symptom onset. The serial interval of 8.5 days for symptom onset was similar to an estimate from the United Kingdom of 9.8 days after correcting for right-truncation but shorter than the generation time of 12.5 days reported from Italy. The serial interval correlates with human behavior and can decrease with increasing awareness among men who have sex with men or interventions, a pattern similar to that observed among the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Italy estimates were from the initial period of the epidemic (May-June 2022), whereas our study was for July-August 2022. Serial interval changes can be very rapid. We also found a serial interval of 7.0 days for rash onset. The estimated serial interval for symptom onset was longer than that for the incubation period (5.6 days), suggesting most transmission occurred after the onset of symptoms in the primary case-patient. Conversely, the serial interval for rash onset (7.0 days) was slightly shorter than that for the rash incubation period (7.5 days), which may suggest some prerash transmission; indeed, there were instances in the observed data where secondary case-patients were exposed before onset of reported rash in the primary case-patient. However, the credible intervals for the estimates overlap. The serial interval for symptom onset ranged from 2 to 25 days. This wide range may be attributable in part to variability in the nature and intensity of contact.

The 1st limitation of this study is that precise ascertainment of symptom and rash onset dates is critical for serial interval estimation, but initial mpox symptoms are often nonspecific and may be unrelated to MPXV infection. Second, despite careful selection of linked primary and secondary case pairs, exposure from additional unknown sources may have occurred. Third, social desirability bias may have factored into the self-reported exposures before infection. Fourth, serial interval may vary by age, underlying conditions, vaccination status, or contact type (route of exposure); we did not stratify our analysis by these factors because of limited data. Fifth, we excluded secondary case-patients who had symptom onset on the same day as or before the primary case-patient to ensure a high degree of confidence linking case pairs; however, the serial interval could be negative. Sixth, the serial interval for rash onset could be biased if rash is more quickly identified in the secondary case-patient because of case finding and investigation of the primary case-patient.

Notwithstanding those limitations, our estimate of the serial interval for MPXV infection includes more case pairs than have been reported previously from the United Kingdom and Italy. We also provide estimates for rash onset, which may be more reliable than initial symptom onset for determining serial interval.

[This study provides preliminary evidence that the serial interval of mpox is approximately 8-12 days, but further research is needed. Although a rough estimate at this point, these data can help inform the public on how to take proper precautions to help stop the spread of mpox. This is also extremely relevant as we head into the festival and pride seasons as stated in the article. A system for reporting dates of exposure along with when patients become symptomatic is needed to ensure the data can be used to full effect and updated with new case information. - Mod.CS]

Abstract
--------
A healthy young man first diagnosed with mpox in May 2022 presented again in November 2022 with anal proctitis and a positive PCR on a rectal swab for MPX virus (MPXV) after a recent trip to Brazil, where he engaged in condomless sexual intercourse with multiple male partners.

[This is one of the few instances of reinfection that has been seen since this outbreak began. Although this report did not include more information about this patient's vaccination status, patient education needs to focus on safe sex practices as well. Vaccination, while helpful, is not completely effective at preventing further infection, and continued exposure to the virus in vaccinated patients could contribute to possible mutations in the future. - Mod.CS]

<https://outbreaknewstoday.com/mexico-reports-more-than-50-mpox-cases-in-two-weeks-90775/>


The Mexico Ministry of Health reports that in the last 14 days a total of 74 probable cases and 51 confirmed cases of mpox or monkeypox have been identified in the country.

The Fortnightly Technical Report on Epidemiological Surveillance in Mexico states that since the confirmation of the 1st case on 28 May 2022, and until 6 Mar 2023, 6559 people who meet the definition have been identified. Of these, 3928 were confirmed, 293 are under study, and 2338 were ruled out by laboratory tests.

The Institute of Epidemiological Diagnosis and Reference (InDRE) notified that the accumulated positive cases are distributed in the 32 states: Mexico City, 2029 infections; Jalisco, 402; State of Mexico, 361; Quintana Roo, 238; Yucatan, 169; Nuevo Leon, 125; Puebla, 68; Veracruz, 64; Tabasco, 57; Chiapas, 52; Lower California, 32; Tamaulipas, 31; Queretaro, 30; Hidalgo, 26; and Morelos, 25.

In addition, Campeche, 23; Chihuahua, 25; Guanajuato, 22; Sinaloa, 19; Aguascalientes, 18; Coahuila, 16; Guerrero, 15; Oaxaca, 14; San Luis Potosi, 12; Tlaxcala, 12; Nayarit, 10; Michoacán, 8; Baja California Sur, 6; Colima, 6; Sound, 5; Zacatecas, 5; and Durango, 3.

Regarding the distribution by sex assigned at birth, the predominance is in men, with 97%; the age group from 30 to 34 years is the one with the highest prevalence, which presents an incidence rate of 10.8 per 100 000 inhabitants; that is, 1025 of the 3928 confirmed cases.

Regarding the gender of those who provide information, 95.76% corresponds to male and 3.29%, female; 0.22% is non-binary; 0.11%, bigender; 0.20%, transgender; and 0.42% corresponds to another group.

The most common symptoms reported are rash in 100% of cases, followed by fever in 72.1%, and headaches in 62.9%. Those who live with HIV, suffer from syphilis and diabetes mellitus, among others, are more vulnerable to developing the disease.

As of 6 Mar 2023, 18 deaths have been identified, of which 4 are directly related to mpox infection, 2 are not related to this cause, and 12 are being analyzed by a group of experts in infectious diseases and epidemiology to define whether there is a causal association between death and mpox infection. These are 17 men and one woman who during medical care presented lesions compatible with mpox.

[Jalisco, State of Mexico, and Quintana Roo are all popular vacation destinations for members of the gay community with many groups planning annual trips, especially to Puerto Vallarta. Given the statistics reported in this article, the spread of mpox in these areas is not surprising. Efforts to vaccinate members of these communities need to be made, as well as in other areas where travel within these communities is popular. This includes places like Provincetown, Mykonos, and Fire Island, which are all popular summer vacation destinations for the gay community. Areas that host large music festivals as well should consider education and vaccination campaigns for their citizens to help prevent outbreaks moving forward. - Mod.CS]

<https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/mpox/1-dose-jynneos-vaccine-effectiveness-against-symptomatic-mpox-estimated-78>


Estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) of a single dose of the Jynneos attenuated smallpox/mpox vaccine against symptomatic mpox infection was 78% at least 14 days later, according to a study published yesterday [13 Mar 2023] in The Lancet Infectious Diseases.

Researchers at the UK Health Security Agency sent questionnaires to men who have sex with men (MSM) in England diagnosed as having mpox from 4 Jul to 9 Oct 2022, and linked the answers to lab data and a public health case-management system.

The team calculated VE by comparing vaccine coverage among eligible patients from the number of estimated doses given to at-risk MSM and the estimated size of that population.

By October [2022], 47% of 363 mpox patients had received one dose of the Jynneos vaccine. Eight respondents (2.2%) had breakthrough infections at least 14 days after vaccination, 32 (8.8%) were diagnosed within 13 days after vaccination, and 323 (89.0%) were unvaccinated.

Estimated one-dose VE against symptomatic mpox was 78% after at least 14 days (95% confidence [CI], 54% to 89%), ranging from 71% to 85% in sensitivity analyses. VE was -4% in the first 13 days after vaccination (95% CI, -50% to 29%).

""A single MVA-BN [Jynneos] dose was highly protective against symptomatic mpox disease among at-risk [MSM], making it a useful tool for mpox outbreak control when rapid protection is needed,"" the authors wrote. ""For cases in which numbers at highest risk of infection exceed vaccine supply, there might be benefit in prioritising delivery of 1st doses.""

In a related commentary, Dimie Ogina, MBBS, of Niger Delta University in Nigeria, and Nathalie Strub-Wourgaft, MD, of the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative in Switzerland, noted that half of the breakthrough mpox infections occurred in HIV patients.

""However, the MVA-BN vaccines have previously been shown to be immunogenic among adults with a history of AIDS, and larger cohorts of people living with HIV will be required to ascertain if HIV is a risk factor for MVA-BN vaccine failure,"" they wrote.

A rapid response medical team has been dispatched to Kagera Region to investigate an unknown disease that has killed 5 people. Two other patients have been admitted. Chief Medical Officer Prof Tumaini Nagu's report released on Thursday [16 Mar 2023] says areas that have been affected by the mysterious disease are Bulinda and Butayaieba villages of Maruku and Kanyangereko wards, respectively, in Bukoba Rural District.

""The Government is closely monitoring the situation and take measures to contain the disease,"" Prof Nagu states in the statement made available to the Daily News. The government is carrying out a public health awareness campaign in Kagera for people to take all necessary precautions.

The health expert has advised anyone with high fever, vomiting and diarrhoea and bleeding to immediately report to a health center for investigation and treatments. She has also advised people to avoid shaking hands with people who have such symptoms.

Tanzania has asked medical experts to investigate a mysterious ""communicable"" disease that has already killed 5 people in the country, authorities said.

The disease has been detected in ""7 people with symptoms such as fever, vomiting, bleeding and kidney failure,"" the health ministry said in a statement late Thursday night [16 Mar 2023]. Medical experts have been dispatched to the Kagera region (northwest) bordering Uganda to investigate the ""communicable"" disease, said health official Tumaini Nagu.

""Samples have been taken from patients and the dead to identify the source and type of disease,"" she said in a statement, calling on the population to remain calm.

The case comes after an Ebola outbreak in Uganda that lasted almost 4 months and left 55 people dead. Uganda declared the end of the outbreak in January [2023]. Last year [2022], Tanzania identified an outbreak of leptospirosis, or ""rat disease,"" a disease whose symptoms included nosebleeds, fever, headaches and fatigue, that killed 3 people in the southeastern region of Lindi.

[Few clinical and epidemiologic details are given in the above initial reports beyond the fact that the disease is characterized by high fever, vomiting, diarrhea and bleeding, with an apparently high fatality rate. Such features are found in a number of viral hemorrhagic fevers, including Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), Marburg Virus Disease, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Rift Valley fever (RVF), and yellow fever. EVD should certainly be ruled out as quickly as possible, given the 2022 Ebola outbreak that occurred in Uganda, which borders the Kagera region. 

In 2019, EVD was also a possible concern in an undiagnosed fatal illness in a Tanzanian student that occurred at the same time as an Ebola outbreak in neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo (see below under See Also). A major RVF epidemic in eastern Africa occurred in 2007 that involved Tanzania as well as Kenya and Somalia. In July 2022, a disease outbreak characterized by fever, headache, fatigue and bleeding (especially from the nose) that occurred in the southern Lindi region, affecting 20 people with 3 fatalities, was ultimately identified as leptospirosis. Undiagnosed fatalities due to aflatoxin poisoning have also occurred in Tanzania.

Given that the above differential diagnosis includes communicable viral hemorrhagic fevers, it is essential that rapid diagnosis, isolation of cases and contact tracing be implemented without waiting for the causal agent to be identified. More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

The latest data from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) shows that scarlet fever infections and invasive group A streptococcus (iGAS) infections remain high, although they have significantly reduced since the peak in December 2022.

High levels of activity at such an early point in the season remains a concern, with further increases possible in the coming weeks as we move towards the usual peak time of the year for infections. While iGAS is still very rare, notifications remain relatively high in children compared to what we typically see -- these rates are more in keeping with the previous high season of 2017 to 2018.

There continue to be increased notifications in older adult age groups, and as in previous seasons, the majority of iGAS cases have continued to be among those aged over 45 years, particularly in those aged over 75 years.

So far this season (from 12 Sep 2022 to 10 Mar 2023), there have been 49 372 notifications of scarlet fever. In the last comparable high season (from September 2017 to September 2018) there were 30 768 scarlet fever notifications overall across the year.

iGAS infections remain rare but are currently higher than expected in a typical year. So far this season, there have been:

- 2415 iGAS cases across all age groups, compared to 2898 across the whole of the last comparably high season in 2017 to 2018
- 575 iGAS cases in children aged 18 years and under, compared to 205 cases in the 2017 to 2018 season

Sadly, so far this season, there have been 319 deaths across all age groups in England. This figure includes 40 children aged under 18 years in England. In the September 2017 to September 2018 season, there were 354 deaths in total across the season, including 27 deaths among children aged under 18 years.

Cases of a tick-borne disease, called babesiosis, more than doubled in some northeastern states between 2011 and 2019, researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported on Thursday [16 Mar 2023] (<https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7211a1.htm>).

Although many people with babesiosis are asymptomatic, others develop flulike symptoms, including fevers, chills, sweats and muscle aches (<https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/babesiosis/disease.html>). The disease can be severe or even fatal in people who have compromised immune systems or other risk factors.

The disease, which for decades was extremely rare in the United States, is now endemic in 10 states in the Northeast and the Midwest, the agency said. The increase may have been fueled by rising temperatures and the growing population of deer, 2 factors that help ticks thrive, experts said. ""I think this is an unfortunate milestone,"" said Dr. Peter Krause, a babesiosis expert at the Yale School of Public Health, who was not involved in the study.

Babesiosis is caused by parasites that typically make themselves at home in mice and other rodents. Poppy seed-size blacklegged ticks, which are also known as deer ticks and can transmit Lyme disease, can spread the disease to humans after feeding on infected mice.

The 1st person known to have been infected in the United States was reported in 1969 in Massachusetts. Today, most cases occur in the Northeast and the upper Midwest in the spring and summer. (The parasite can also be transmitted by blood transfusions, and the Food and Drug Administration recommends screening donated blood in certain states.)

In the new study, researchers analyzed 16 174 babesiosis cases reported in 10 states between 2011 and 2019. In 2019 alone, there were more than 2300 cases, more than twice as many as in 2011. The disease was most common in New York, Massachusetts and Connecticut, which typically tallied hundreds of cases per year.

But there were regional differences in the trends. In 2 Midwestern states, Minnesota and Wisconsin, the number of annual cases held relatively steady. By contrast, in 8 northeastern states, the number of cases increased significantly over that period, with the steepest increases in Vermont, Maine, New Hampshire and Connecticut.

In 3 of those states -- Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont -- babesiosis had not previously been considered endemic. The increases in those states are particularly notable, said Edouard Vannier, a babesiosis expert at Tufts Medical Center in Boston who was not involved in the new study. ""The disease is going north,"" he said. ""And it's probably due to climate change.""

The ticks, which prefer warm, wet conditions, have indeed expanded their territory northward (<https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/13/us/lone-star-tick-bite-meat-allergy.html>). The findings highlight the need to expand surveillance and screening for the disease, Dr. Vannier said.

A growing deer population could also be fueling the rise in babesiosis. Although deer do not carry the parasites that cause babesiosis, they are the preferred food source for adult ticks. ""That greatly amplifies the number of ticks,"" Dr. Krause said. ""A lot more survive, a lot more females lay eggs.""

The building of new housing in areas where ticks are present could also play a role, he added, as could increased awareness, which may be prompting more doctors to test patients for the disease.

It is unclear why the midwestern states have not experienced the same rise in cases. ""I don't have an explanation for it,"" Dr. Vannier said. But the disease had typically been less common there than in the Northeast, he noted.

Babesiosis can be treated with antimicrobial drugs. It can be prevented by avoiding tall grass and underbrush, and wearing long pants and tick repellent, in areas where the disease is endemic. Daily tick checks can help people spot and remove the ticks before the arachnids have the chance to transmit the parasite.

Summary
------
""What is already known about this topic? Babesiosis is an emerging zoonotic tickborne parasitic disease in the United States and occurs primarily in the Northeast and Midwest.

""What is added by this report? During 2011-2019, US babesiosis incidence significantly increased in northeastern states. Three states (Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont) that were not considered to have endemic babesiosis had significantly increasing incidences and reported case counts similar to or higher than those in the 7 states with known endemic transmission.

""What are the implications for public health practice? As case rates rise in multiple states, tick prevention messaging, provider education, and traveler risk awareness should be emphasized.""

The following is extracted from my moderator comments in a prior ProMED post (Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, babesiosis - USA: (ME) 20220819.8705108):

""An increased incidence of Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, and babesiosis can be due to a true increase in the number of cases as the primary vector and the reservoir hosts expand locally or spread geographically into previously uninvolved regions, but also better recognition and reporting of these diseases may contribute to the increases in the number of reported cases.

""Factors that could account for a true increase in the incidence of these tick-borne diseases in the US state of Maine include climate change, growth of suburban neighborhoods into surrounding wooded areas, and enlarging populations of deer, white-footed mice, and other small rodents, and _Borrelia burgdorferi_-infected nymphal _Ixodes scapularis_. Nymphal _I. scapularis_ are the primary tick vector for these diseases in the northeastern US and southeastern Canada. Deer, although not susceptible to Lyme disease, supply the adult tick with a required blood meal and they are responsible for transporting ticks; white-footed mice and other small rodents are the primary reservoirs for Lyme disease.

""_I. scapularis_ likely traveled from endemic areas in the northeastern US by attaching themselves onto migrating mammals and birds (<https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/07/150706143251.htm>). Deer ticks by themselves unlikely travel far; travel over greater distances is achieved by the ticks' attaching themselves to migrating mammals and birds. Ticks can only climb the short distance on vegetation to a height at which they are most likely to contact their preferred host and wait (known as ""questing"") for a host to pass by. Nymphs quest for a blood meal at temperatures greater than 7 deg C/45 deg F (<http://jtm.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/1/39.long>).

""A photo of the characteristic rash of early Lyme disease can be found at <http://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lyme_disease_picture/picture.htm>.

""In the United States, _I. scapularis_ can transmit simultaneously one or more of the following pathogens: _Borrelia burgdorferi_ (the spirochete that causes Lyme disease), _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ (a bacterium that causes human granulocytic anaplasmosis or HGA), _Borrelia miyamotoi_ (a spirochete that causes a relapsing fever-like illness), _Babesia microti_ (the protozoan that causes babesiosis), and Powassan virus (a virus that causes encephalitis) (<https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2020.00142/full>). For a picture of the tick nymph, see <http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/babesiosis/>.

""A prevalence of 45% of deer ticks carrying the bacterium that causes Lyme disease is high and means that there are many infected white-footed mice (_Peromyscus leucopus_) on which ticks fed. White-footed mice are the reservoir of _B. burgdorferi_.

""Decreased rainfall in the summer months in Maine could have reduced the questing nymph tick population because nymph ticks require a high humidity of more than 85% (<http://jtm.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/1/39.long>), forcing them to move down the vegetation into more humid leaf litter on the ground to maintain hydration during summer drought conditions.

""The increased incidence of Lyme disease and anaplasmosis in Maine could be due to an increase in the number of questing infected tick vectors during a wet fall season. Because nymphs quest for a blood meal at temperatures greater than 7 deg C/45 deg F (<http://jtm.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/1/39.long>), the local daytime temperatures in the fall season would have to be above this value. In fact, daytime temperatures are mostly above 7 deg C/45 deg F in September and October in Maine (<https://www.currentresults.com/Weather/Maine/temperature-october.php>).""

""It should be noted that cases are reported by county of residence, which is assumed to be the county of exposure. But people are often exposed to infected ticks outside their county of residence."" - Mod.ML

As case rates rise in multiple states, tick prevention messaging, provider education, and traveler risk awareness should be emphasized.""The following is extracted from my moderator comments in a prior ProMED post (Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, babesiosis - USA: (ME) 20220819.8705108):""An increased incidence of Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, and babesiosis can be due to a true increase in the number of cases as the primary vector and the reservoir hosts expand locally or spread geographically into previously uninvolved regions, but also better recognition and reporting of these diseases may contribute to the increases in the number of reported cases.""Factors that could account for a true increase in the incidence of these tick-borne diseases in the US state of Maine include climate change, growth of suburban neighborhoods into surrounding wooded areas, and enlarging populations of deer, white-footed mice, and other small rodents, and _Borrelia burgdorferi_-infected nymphal _Ixodes scapularis_. Nymphal _I. scapularis_ are the primary tick vector for these diseases in the northeastern US and southeastern Canada. Deer, although not susceptible to Lyme disease, supply the adult tick with a required blood meal and they are responsible for transporting ticks; white-footed mice and other small rodents are the primary reservoirs for Lyme disease.""_I. scapularis_ likely traveled from endemic areas in the northeastern US by attaching themselves onto migrating mammals and birds (<https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/07/150706143251.htm>). Deer ticks by themselves unlikely travel far; travel over greater distances is achieved by the ticks' attaching themselves to migrating mammals and birds. Ticks can only climb the short distance on vegetation to a height at which they are most likely to contact their preferred host and wait (known as ""questing"") for a host to pass by. Nymphs quest for a blood meal at temperatures greater than 7 deg C/45 deg F (<http://jtm.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/1/39.long>).""A photo of the characteristic rash of early Lyme disease can be found at <http://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lyme_disease_picture/picture.htm>.""In the United States, _I. scapularis_ can transmit simultaneously one or more of the following pathogens: _Borrelia burgdorferi_ (the spirochete that causes Lyme disease), _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ (a bacterium that causes human granulocytic anaplasmosis or HGA), _Borrelia miyamotoi_ (a spirochete that causes a relapsing fever-like illness), _Babesia microti_ (the protozoan that causes babesiosis), and Powassan virus (a virus that causes encephalitis) (<https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2020.00142/full>). For a picture of the tick nymph, see <http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/babesiosis/>.""A prevalence of 45% of deer ticks carrying the bacterium that causes Lyme disease is high and means that there are many infected white-footed mice (_Peromyscus leucopus_) on which ticks fed. White-footed mice are the reservoir of _B. burgdorferi_.""Decreased rainfall in the summer months in Maine could have reduced the questing nymph tick population because nymph ticks require a high humidity of more than 85% (<http://jtm.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/1/39.long>), forcing them to move down the vegetation into more humid leaf litter on the ground to maintain hydration during summer drought conditions.""The increased incidence of Lyme disease and anaplasmosis in Maine could be due to an increase in the number of questing infected tick vectors during a wet fall season. Because nymphs quest for a blood meal at temperatures greater than 7 deg C/45 deg F (<http://jtm.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/1/39.long>), the local daytime temperatures in the fall season would have to be above this value. In fact, daytime temperatures are mostly above 7 deg C/45 deg F in September and October in Maine (<https://www.currentresults.com/Weather/Maine/temperature-october.php>).""""It should be noted that cases are reported by county of residence, which is assumed to be the county of exposure.

GPEI Statement on cVDPV2 detections in Burundi and Democratic Republic of the Congo - 16 Mar 2023
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Through ongoing surveillance, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) has received notification of the detection of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) in Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) linked with the novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2). The viruses were isolated from the stool samples of 7 children with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) -- 6 in DRC (eastern Tanganyika and South Kivu provinces), 1 in Burundi (Bujumbura Rural province) -- and from 5 environmental samples collected in Burundi (Bujumbura Mairie province). All reported isolates stem from 2 separate and new emergences of cVDPV2 linked with nOPV2 that originated in Tanganyika and South Kivu provinces in DRC.

GPEI is supporting local authorities in both and neighbouring countries to conduct a thorough risk assessment and plan vaccination responses to reduce the risk of further transmission, as per outbreak response protocols. Burundi and DRC have scheduled initial vaccination campaigns to be conducted in April [2023] and based on the ongoing risk assessment, subsequent campaigns may be expanded to include areas in neighbouring countries.

Additionally, both AFP and environmental surveillance are being stepped up in the areas of detection, and the operationalization of further environmental surveillance sites is being evaluated. Samples from Burundi, DRC, and neighbouring countries are also being prioritized for testing by the Global Polio Laboratory Network.

These are the 1st instances of cVDPV2 linked with nOPV2 since roll-out of the vaccine began in March 2021. While detection of these outbreaks is a tragedy for the families and communities affected, it is not unexpected with wider use of the vaccine. All available clinical and field evidence continues to demonstrate that nOPV2 is safe and effective and has a significantly lower risk of reverting to a form that cause paralysis in low immunity settings when compared to monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2).

To date [16 Mar 2023], close to 600 million doses of nOPV2 have been administered across 28 countries globally, and the majority of countries have seen no further transmission of cVDPV2 after 2 immunization rounds. Throughout the vaccine's extensive field use, the strains in DRC and Burundi are the only 2 cVDPV2 emergences detected that have been linked with nOPV2. A preliminary assessment suggests an estimated 30-40 new cVDPV2 emergences, conditional on surveillance inputs, would have been detected by 1 Mar 2023 if mOPV2 was used instead of nOPV2 at the same scale.

Focused safety, effectiveness and genetic stability monitoring will continue for the duration of the vaccine's use under WHO Emergency Use Listing (EUL) and work continues to advance towards nOPV2's WHO prequalification, expected by the end of this year [2023].

Importantly, eastern DRC is classified as 1 of GPEI's 7 most consequential geographies for poliovirus outbreak risk. Complex humanitarian challenges in the country, including insecurity, have created longstanding barriers to reaching every child with the polio vaccine. This has contributed to the continued spread of variant poliovirus within DRC and its exportation to nearby countries. GPEI continues to adapt its strategy and work with local authorities to protect all children from this devastating disease through targeted, flexible campaign efforts.

Ultimately, no vaccine sitting in a vial can protect a child. The success of nOPV2 and any polio vaccine depends on the ability to rapidly implement high-quality immunization campaigns to ensure that every child is vaccinated and poliovirus' spread is stopped.

[The nOPV2 has been the hope of the polio eradication effort to eliminate the cVDPV2 outbreaks being seen in more than 30 countries. The vaccine was described as more stable than the current OPV2 with no real reversions seen during clinical trials. I recommend reading the 3 posts in which we covered nOPV2 (Poliomyelitis update (18): cVDPV2 (Pakistan, CAR, Chad, Somalia), nOPV2 20201211.8009474, Poliomyelitis update (103): global (WPV1, cVDPV) Pakistan, nOPV2 soon to release 20191220.6850114, Poliomyelitis update (44): WPV1, cVDPV2, WHO, nOPV2 20190606.6507515). In the post Poliomyelitis update (103): global (WPV1, cVDPV) Pakistan, nOPV2 soon to release 20191220.6850114, my moderator comment said the following: ""Reading this article has me very cautious about the early release of the nOPV2. It doesn't mention the size of the study population. The one paper I was able to find on the early studies on this vaccine mentions a cohort of 30 individuals with previous history of IPV (inactivated polio vaccine) vaccination. A very small study size when compared with the millions of children who will be vaccinated with this vaccine. I am also reminded of the observation that OPV was in use for 20+ years before cVDPVs were recognized (field trials in the early 60s). One thought is what happens to the nOPV2 after multiple passages through unvaccinated/susceptible individuals in areas with pockets of susceptibles?""

The paper I referred to in the post is: Van Damme P, De Coster I, Bandyopadhyay AS, et al. The safety and immunogenicity of 2 novel live attenuated monovalent (serotype 2) oral poliovirus vaccines in healthy adults: a double-blind, single-centre phase 1 study.

And is the discussion over IPV entering the immunization programs worldwide to replace the use of OPV up for renewal?

[3] Israel: 175 000 of less than 2-year-old children unvaccinated
Date: Mon 13 Mar 2023
Source: The Times of Israel [edited]
<https://www.timesofisrael.com/some-175000-israeli-kids-not-immunized-against-polio-virus-health-ministry/>


At least 175 000 Israeli children have not been vaccinated against polio, a viral disease that mainly affects children and can cause disability, paralysis and death, according to a new assessment by the Health Ministry cited by Channel 12 on Monday [13 Mar 2023].

Parents of children who have not been immunized were urged to take them to a local health center to receive the vaccine.

Polio vaccinations are standard for children and are an effective preventive measure, but vaccine skepticism has recently enabled the disease to rear its head again.

Earlier this month [March 2023], 4 children were diagnosed with the disease in the northern city of Safed, and the Health Ministry warned that there was evidence in recent months ""of a spread of polio in many sewage systems in Israel."" The ministry said at the time that it estimated that 150 000 Israeli children were unvaccinated against the virus, 25 000 fewer than Monday's [13 Mar 2023] figures. Three of the children became infected with the virus after being exposed to an 8-year-old girl in Safed who tested positive for the polio virus despite not having any symptoms. [the 8-year old had AFP; the 3 contacts were asymptomatic infections - Mod.MPP]

The Health Ministry said it would continue to monitor and update the public, and encouraged people to maintain good hygiene practices to stymie any outbreak.

Last March [2022], the 1st case of polio in 33 years was discovered in Israel, leading to a small outbreak and a vaccination drive to combat the disease. [There were 6 confirmed AFP cases plus 1 highly suspected. All were not vaccinated. The outbreak was associated with a cVDPV3. See Poliomyelitis update (14): Israel, RFI 20220331.8702310. - Mod.MPP]

The finding landed Israel on the World Health Organization's Polio Eradication Initiative's list of countries with outbreaks, after being declared polio-free in 1988.

On Friday [10 Mar 2023], the State of New York's health department called for residents to get vaccinated against polio before traveling to Israel, warning of the recent diagnoses in the country. In a statement, the New York Department of Health called on New Yorkers ""to get fully immunized"" before flying to Israel or other countries with polio.

.................................................mpp/may/lxl","At least 175 000 Israeli children have not been vaccinated against polio, a viral disease that mainly affects children and can cause disability, paralysis and death, according to a new assessment by the Health Ministry cited by Channel 12 on Monday [13 Mar 2023].Parents of children who have not been immunized were urged to take them to a local health center to receive the vaccine.Polio vaccinations are standard for children and are an effective preventive measure, but vaccine skepticism has recently enabled the disease to rear its head again.Earlier this month [March 2023], 4 children were diagnosed with the disease in the northern city of Safed, and the Health Ministry warned that there was evidence in recent months ""of a spread of polio in many sewage systems in Israel."" The ministry said at the time that it estimated that 150 000 Israeli children were unvaccinated against the virus, 25 000 fewer than Monday's [13 Mar 2023] figures. Three of the children became infected with the virus after being exposed to an 8-year-old girl in Safed who tested positive for the polio virus despite not having any symptoms. [the 8-year old had AFP; the 3 contacts were asymptomatic infections - Mod.MPP]The Health Ministry said it would continue to monitor and update the public, and encouraged people to maintain good hygiene practices to stymie any outbreak.Last March [2022], the 1st case of polio in 33 years was discovered in Israel, leading to a small outbreak and a vaccination drive to combat the disease. [There were 6 confirmed AFP cases plus 1 highly suspected. All were not vaccinated. The outbreak was associated with a cVDPV3. See Poliomyelitis update (14): Israel, RFI 20220331.8702310. - Mod.MPP]The finding landed Israel on the World Health Organization's Polio Eradication Initiative's list of countries with outbreaks, after being declared polio-free in 1988.On Friday [10 Mar 2023], the State of New York's health department called for residents to get vaccinated against polio before traveling to Israel, warning of the recent diagnoses in the country. In a statement, the New York Department of Health called on New Yorkers ""to get fully immunized"" before flying to Israel or other countries with polio.

There are 54 registered cases [of leptospirosis] in Ecuador, as announced by the Ministry of Health.

An 18-year-old woman died of leptospirosis in the Santo Domingo de los Tsáchilas province. There are 4 people receiving treatment, as announced by Francisco Ayala, provincial director of Health. According to Ayala, the 5 registered cases occurred in the Cristo Vive cooperative, specifically, on the road that leads to the Bellavista prison. They were infected on the Carnival holiday, when bathing in a pool in the sector.

The symptoms appeared 6 days ago, approximately, when they arrived at the health centers, where they underwent the corresponding tests. ""Unfortunately, an 18-year-old girl died; her condition was complicated because, in addition to leptospirosis, she had other diseases. The others are stable.

Francisco Pérez, Undersecretary of Surveillance, Prevention and Health Control, indicated that leptospirosis is a disease that exists in Ecuador; however, in recent weeks, as a result of the winter season, cases have increased, reaching 54 in the country.

He said that the epidemic occurs in places where there is no [safe] drinking water, sewerage [the infrastructure that conveys sewage or surface runoff], and there is little environmental sanitation.

The provinces with the highest infections are: Guayas with 32 cases, Manabí with 9 and Santo Domingo de los Tsáchilas with 5.

After receiving the results of the examinations, personnel from the Ministry of Health traveled to the area of origin of the epidemic, to carry out prevention campaigns and deliver medicines to about 190 people who had contact with the patients.

Ayala recommended [people in] Santo Domingo not to walk barefoot, or have contact with stagnant water, [and] always wash food [with uncontaminated water] to avoid getting infected.
 
So far, they have only registered 5 cases; they are waiting for more results to find out if the disease persists in other areas of Santo Domingo. 

The people who were confirmed as positive are between 17 to 20 years in age.

The number of people infected with leptospirosis have increased to 16. There are patients in intensive care units, apparently stable, while others are in hospital and in their homes.

The increase from 5 to 16 cases of people infected with leptospirosis prompted the authorities to activate the Technical Health Table, to take biosecurity measures and prevent the disease from spreading further.

The 11 new confirmed cases so far are from the cooperatives Cristo Vive and Rumiñahui, as well as from km 1 of Quevedo avenue, from whom samples tested positive.

Among the 1st 5 cases is that of the 18-year-old girl, who died and the infection was detected when the autopsy was performed.

There are patients in intensive care units (ICU) who are apparently stable, while others are hospitalized and in their homes. The Ministry of Public Health (MSP) continues to carry out epidemiological surveillance where cases have occurred.

Mayra Quiroz, municipal director of Environmental Management, maintained that after the alert issued by the MSP, they intensified the rat extermination campaign in the cooperative where the 1st outbreak occurred. The technicians arrived in several sectors with an insecticide that they placed in strategic places and that makes the rodent petrify. They also destroyed the burrows to prevent them from reproducing. The official said that this type of work is carried out every month, they intervene in health centers in urban and rural areas. The work is carried out in markets too, where these types of animals accumulate the most.

Likewise, he indicated that pets, such as dogs and cats, can also be infected with the disease and can be transmitting entities, for which reason he recommended that they be vaccinated.

The residents of Cristo Vive wait for the authorities to arrive in the sector, to try to exterminate the rodents that infest the area, especially in abandoned houses.

Ana Zambrano, a general practitioner, pointed out that a person who is infected with leptospirosis and is not treated quickly can die in less than 10 days. Diarrhea that occurs should be controlled with constant hydration. Those who present symptoms of high fever, headache, chills, red eyes, vomiting and diarrhea should immediately go to a health facility.

This disease is transmitted through skin contact with dirty or stagnant water, and with food contaminated by rodent urine.

It is recommended not to self-medicate, as it would be dangerous to health.

Heavy rainfall in February 2023 caused freshwater flooding in multiple regions of Ecuador (<https://floodlist.com/america/ecuador-floods-february-2023>), but flooding is being compounded in Santo Domingo de los Tsáchilas Province by an infestation of rats that excrete _Leptospira_ in their urine, contaminating the floodwater. A similar situation is occurring in Guayas Province. 

Many species of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and rats) are susceptible to chronic kidney infection with pathogenic _Leptospira_. Leptospirosis is usually acquired after contact of the skin or mucous membranes with the urine of infected animals or by contact with fresh water, wet soil, vegetation, or food that has been contaminated by the urine of leptospira-infected animals, especially rats. _Leptospira_ shed in the urine of chronically infected animals may survive in freshwater or moist soil for weeks to months. - Mod.ML

[According to Turkiye's immediate notification and FUR 1, 3 provinces have been affected since the start of the FMDV SAT-2 event, on 3 Mar 2023. These provinces, located in the east, border each other and neighboring countries, as follows: the provinces of Ağrı, bordering Iran to the east; Iğdır, bordering on its east Armenia, Azerbaijan (the area of Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic) and Iran; and Kars, bordering Armenia. In each province, one village was reported affected. Out of a total of 4944 susceptible cattle in the 3 provinces combined, 7 clinical cases are reported; no deaths. For an exotic FMD serotype, against which the domestic ruminant population is fully susceptible, this is a rather benign presentation of the event than expected, based on previous experience. - Mod.AS]

Turkiye isolates 215 villages due to foot-and-mouth disease outbreak
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Turkish authorities have announced the isolation of villages in the northern region of Zonguldak, due to the spread of the foot-and-mouth disease virus among animals.

Teams from the provincial Directorate of Agriculture and Forestry have begun vaccination studies in areas where the disease was found, according to local media reports.

The incubation period of the virus in the body of animals is up to 15 days. The disease leads to lowered milk production, eating disorder and high temperatures.

Foot-and-mouth disease is transmitted from one animal to another by various means, including feed.

The foot-and-mouth disease virus is not transmitted to humans through meat.

National Health Mission adopts 'fire fighter' model to check outbreak of measles in Madhya Pradesh
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
National Health Mission (NHM) has adopted the 'Fire fighter' approach to check the measles outbreak in the state. NHM officials said this year [2023] on National Immunization Day, which is going to be observed on 16 Mar 2023, the focus will be on checking measles spread as currently 4 districts in Madhya Pradesh have emerged as hotspots.

As many as 135 cases of measles have been reported across the state. Maximum cases have surfaced in Indore, Narsinghpur, Jabalpur and Burhanpur districts.
.
NHM director Dr Santosh Shukla said that they have adopted a 'fire fighter' model to check the spread of measles in a particular area. ""We have pressed all forces in affected areas right from raising public awareness regarding vaccination, to vaccination and distribution of vitamin tablets to infected children. We handle situations from all corners as it is the need of the hour for our teams.""

The day of 16 Mar is observed as Measles Immunization Day every year in order to raise awareness about this infection and the importance of vaccination to fight it. The firefighter model includes making public announcements to create awareness about the illness as people instead of visiting doctors take their infected children to temple, then we focus on vaccination and distribution of vitamin tablets to boost immunity among children, he added. 

He further said that public announcements are being made from places of worship like mosques, temples and gurudwaras. The parents are advised to consult doctors if the child shows symptoms of measles like fever, cold, cough with rashes. We make them understand that delay in medical treatment leads to complications and it deteriorates a child's health, said Shukla.

Measles outbreak in Jharkhand: Expert says MMR vaccine provides 99% protection against disease
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amid the rising concerns over the increase in measles cases in 9 districts of Jharkhand, the state government has decided to organise a special measles-rubella campaign for 5 weeks from 15 Apr 2023 in these districts.

Under the campaign, 4 562 492 children between the ages of 9 months and 15 years will receive the vaccine as part of the campaign. According to a WHO report, the maximum number of measles patients have been reported in Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Gujarat and Haryana.

They described how a record number of nearly 40 million children had missed at least one measles vaccine dose in 2021. The measles vaccine, which can be administered by itself or in combination with other vaccinations such as mumps and rubella to make up the MMR immunisation, is very effective. Most countries have a 2-dose schedule, with the 1st jab usually given at 12 months of age and the 2nd dose when the child is 4 years old.

MMR vaccines provide long-lasting protection
--------------------------------------------
Dr Hemlata Arora, a general physician and infectious diseases specialist with Nanavati Hospital in Mumbai, spoke with News9 about the importance and effectiveness of the MMR vaccination.

She said, ""Measles, mumps, and rubella are the 3 illnesses that are known to occur commonly and for which vaccinations were developed years ago. Since all 3 of these vaccinations are live and have a similar formulation, they can be blended into one. Live vaccines mean they cannot be given in immunocompromised people.""

The vaccine provides very high and long-lasting protection, and is a model example of the term ""vaccine-preventable disease"". The 2-dose schedule gives about 99% protection against measles infection. In developing countries where vaccine uptake is low, as many as 1 in 10 who get measles, die from it. In developed countries, deaths are overwhelmingly in unvaccinated people at a rate of around 1 in 1000 to 5000 measles cases.

Around 40 children died of measles across the country, out of whom 9 were from Jharkhand, as per reports. Of the 230 measles cases reported in the country, 120 were from Jharkhand.

The districts where the campaign will be carried out are Dumka, Pakur, Sahibganj, Godda, Jamtara, Deoghar, Dhanbad, Koderma and Giridih. Children who have been vaccinated before will be re-vaccinated.

Is MMR immunisation compromised due to the pandemic?
----------------------------------------------------
Scientists say low vaccine coverage rates had already resulted in preventable outbreaks of diseases like measles and polio. In March 2020, WHO and partners asked countries to suspend their polio eradication efforts amid the accelerating COVID-19 pandemic. There have since been dozens of polio epidemics in more than 30 countries.

As per a UN report, ""This is particularly tragic as tremendous progress was made in the 2 decades before the COVID-19 pandemic to improve childhood vaccination rates globally."" Dr Arora said the news was shocking but not surprising, noting that immunisation services are frequently an ""early casualty"" of major social or economic disasters. 

Dr Sumit Chakravarty, senior consultant, Paediatrics and Neonatology and head-NICU, Asian Institute of Medical Sciences in Faridabad said that one can still get complete immunisation even if there has been a delay.

There are many inoculations that are given at 1-and-a-half months, 2-and-a-half months and 3-and-a-half months. Unfortunately, these were missed because parents were scared to step out with their babies.

Diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B, measles, and polio vaccines were some that were missed. These are primary immunisations that are extremely important.

While it was not right to miss them, there is no cause of worry as they can be taken even now.

[The day of 16 Mar is Measles Immunization Day. The impact of measles vaccination rates on disease transmission and outbreaks has been significant. High vaccination rates help in establishing herd immunity and prevent measles outbreaks. ""When a significant portion of the population is vaccinated, the disease becomes less likely to spread, and hence protecting vulnerable individuals. However, a fall in vaccination rates may increase the risk of outbreaks, leading to serious health consequences. Therefore, it is important to maintain high vaccination rates to protect individuals and communities from measles,"" adds Dr Praveen Khilnani, Chairman, Pediatrics, Pediatric Pulmonology and Pediatric Critical Care, Paediatrics, Medanta, Gurugram.

(Barriers to establishment of herd immunity) include vaccine hesitancy, lack of access to healthcare, and misinformation about vaccines. Addressing these challenges requires a multifaceted approach that involves awareness, education, community engagement, and policy initiatives to increase vaccine uptake and promote public health,"" feels Dr Khilnani.

On Measles Immunization Day, it's important to emphasize the role of vaccination and address the concerns of the parents. On the other hand, parents should consult with their healthcare provider to understand the benefits of vaccination and to learn more about the safety and effectiveness of the measles vaccine. Getting vaccinated not only protects children but also helps to prevent the spread of measles in the community,"" signs off Dr Khilnani.

Armenia: Elevated measles activity reported in Armenia in March 2023
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Event
-----
Armenian health officials have reported elevated measles activity, with over 50 cases reported from 1 Jan to 13 Mar 2023. This is compared to the 15 cases reported nationwide in Armenia in 2022. Of the 50 reported cases, 44 were not vaccinated against measles, 4 were partially vaccinated with 1 dose, and 2 were fully vaccinated. The Armenian Ministry of Health has advised that parents should vaccinate their children if they missed any of their scheduled vaccinations. Unvaccinated direct contacts of confirmed cases should also get vaccinated. This report represents the most complete data available as of 14 Mar 2023.

Context
-------
Measles vaccination coverage in Armenia was estimated at 94% in 2020 and 2021, which falls within the 92-95% required to prevent wider community transmission. Armenia reported roughly 15 cases nationwide in 2022, no cases in 2021, and 2020.

Message by the Director of the Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals at WHO - March 2023
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In February [2023], we marked the revitalisation of the Measles and Rubella Initiative, under the new banner of the Measles and Rubella Partnership (MRP), together with UNICEF, US CDC, the American Red Cross, Gavi and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The Measles and Rubella Initiative was launched in 2000: From 2000 to 2021, the annual number of estimated measles deaths decreased 83%. 

Then came the pandemic, and as a result of COVID and related disruptions, we have witnessed the worst continued backsliding in global immunization coverage in 30 years. Measles vaccination coverage has suffered, with the latest data indicating that 40 million children missed at least 1 dose of measles vaccine in 2021 alone. The goal of the MRP is to collaborate with countries and partners to achieve the Immunization Agenda 2030 (IA2030) target, to save another 50 million lives through access to essential vaccines by the end of 2030, with measles immunization contributing a large percentage.

The transition comes at a time when we need to work more closely than ever before, to address the majority of missed and unimmunized children born during 2019 and 2022. In 2021 alone, 25 million children missed at least 1 essential vaccine and 18 million children received no vaccines at all. Our action on immunization in the years leading to 2025 will shape how the story of the pandemic is written. If we fail, we will see tragedies like unprevented cervical cancer and increased child mortality, leading to more deaths in generations that should have been living longer. 

We commend the countries have made great strides in recovering immunization programmes during the height of the pandemic, while noting more remains to be done. Under the banner 'The Big Catch-up', WHO and partners, will coordinate a year-long global push to mobilize and amplify country plans and implementation for catching up on missed children, commitments and plans for catch up, recovery and strengthening. The sum of WHO and partners' year-long activities will be targeted to help achieve: (1) catch-up of individuals who missed out on vaccinations during the pandemic period (by 2023 and at latest by 2025); (2) immunization programme recovery to at least 2019 coverage levels (by 2023); and (3) immunization programme strengthening, to get back onto the 2030 trajectory (by 2023 and at latest by 2025). These efforts will mobilize and accelerate country commitments and plans for catch-up, restore and strengthening, while also mobilizing public support to vaccinate the millions of children and adolescents who have or will be missed, unless action is taken now.

World Immunization Week (WIW) on 24-30 Apr 2023, will be a foundational pillar in this year-long advocacy and communications push, 'The Big Catch-up', to recover lost progress in essential immunization through catch-up, recovery and programme strengthening efforts.
 
WHO will use the WIW 2023 platform to highlight successes from countries from the last few years, with a 'Week of Wins' programme of activities to inspire action by showcasing progress. The visual identity for WIW is being finalized and soon we will share with you the social media hashtags, toolkit, and assets. We anticipate the utility and adaptability of developed assets and cross sharing through the WHO website linking to assets, regional and country content, as well as an external WIW microsite to showcase WHO and partner activities.

During my recent visit to Kenya, I lauded the Ministry of Health's leadership for its resilience in sustaining immunization through COVID-19 and for the positive impact of the malaria vaccine, with nearly 400 000 children reached with the malaria vaccine in the country as of March 2023, resulting in a substantial reduction in severe malaria and a drop in child deaths. Kenya very recently launched an expansion of malaria vaccine delivery into new areas that will more than double the number of children with access to the life-saving vaccine. Across the 3 pilot countries of Ghana, Kenya, and Malawi more than 1.3 million children are protected by the malaria vaccine and more than 4.0 million doses have been administered. Demand for the vaccine is unprecedented with at least 28 countries expressing interest in applying for Gavi support to introduce the vaccine. Of these, 12 countries have submitted a formal application at the first opportunity in the January 2023 application round. The 3 pilot countries have already been approved by Gavi to receive vaccine support to maintain vaccination services in the pilot areas once the pilot programme ends at the end of 2023.

Kenya like many other countries is experiencing outbreaks and I had the opportunity to observe the campaign to mitigate the current cholera outbreak during my visit. Through our ongoing efforts and commitments for catch up, recovery and strengthening, we are amplifying the urgency to act. We must support countries to avoid multiple outbreaks of life-threatening diseases like cholera, diphtheria, measles, and yellow fever and to help every child catch up on their measles, polio, and other vaccines.

We commend the African Union (AU) for its leadership on 2 recent events, demonstrating political alignment and leadership on immunization recovery efforts and strengthening in Africa. We welcome the AU declaration on ""Building momentum for routine immunization recovery in Africa"" at the Heads of State Summit on 19 Feb 2023, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The declaration can be found at <https://www.afro.who.int/media-centre/events/high-level-side-event-36th-ordinary-session-au-assembly-heads-state-and>.

In 2023, we will continue to implement our collective work on our portfolio of highest priority activities including HPV, measles, malaria and zero dose, towards securing the interruption of wild polio transmission, reducing zero dose and achieving measles control, while recognizing the need for immunization programme strengthening cannot be overstated.

[The pandemic has had a huge impact on the global immunization program that must now be addressed in haste. As stated above, ""In 2021 alone, 25 million children missed at least 1 essential vaccine and 18 million children received no vaccines at all."" It is crucial to try to regain the trajectory from prior to the pandemic to avoid future outbreaks.

""Apart from its direct effect on the body, which can be lethal, the measles virus also weakens the immune system and makes a child more vulnerable to other infectious diseases like pneumonia and diarrhea, including for months after the measles infection itself among those who survive. Most cases occur in settings that have faced social and economic hardships due to COVID-19, conflict, or other crises, and have chronically weak health system infrastructure and insecurity. ...

As countries work to respond to outbreaks of measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases, and recover lost ground, UNICEF and WHO, along with partners such as Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the partners of the Measles & Rubella Initiative (M&RI), Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and others are supporting efforts to strengthen immunization systems by:
• Restoring services and vaccination campaigns so countries can safely deliver routine immunization programmes to fill the gaps left by the backsliding;
• Helping health workers and community leaders communicate actively with caregivers to explain the importance of vaccinations;
• Rectifying gaps in immunization coverage, including identifying communities and people who have been missed during the pandemic;
• Ensuring that COVID-19 vaccine delivery is independently financed and well-integrated into overall planning for immunization services so that it is not carried out at the cost of childhood and other vaccination services;
• Implementing country plans to prevent and respond to outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases and strengthening immunization systems as part of COVID-19 recovery efforts.""

We welcome the AU declaration on ""Building momentum for routine immunization recovery in Africa"" at the Heads of State Summit on 19 Feb 2023, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The declaration can be found at <https://www.afro.who.int/media-centre/events/high-level-side-event-36th-ordinary-session-au-assembly-heads-state-and>.In 2023, we will continue to implement our collective work on our portfolio of highest priority activities including HPV, measles, malaria and zero dose, towards securing the interruption of wild polio transmission, reducing zero dose and achieving measles control, while recognizing the need for immunization programme strengthening cannot be overstated.--Communicated by:ProMED from Google Alerts[The pandemic has had a huge impact on the global immunization program that must now be addressed in haste. As stated above, ""In 2021 alone, 25 million children missed at least 1 essential vaccine and 18 million children received no vaccines at all."" It is crucial to try to regain the trajectory from prior to the pandemic to avoid future outbreaks.""Apart from its direct effect on the body, which can be lethal, the measles virus also weakens the immune system and makes a child more vulnerable to other infectious diseases like pneumonia and diarrhea, including for months after the measles infection itself among those who survive. Most cases occur in settings that have faced social and economic hardships due to COVID-19, conflict, or other crises, and have chronically weak health system infrastructure and insecurity. ...As countries work to respond to outbreaks of measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases, and recover lost ground, UNICEF and WHO, along with partners such as Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the partners of the Measles & Rubella Initiative (M&RI), Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and others are supporting efforts to strengthen immunization systems by:• Restoring services and vaccination campaigns so countries can safely deliver routine immunization programmes to fill the gaps left by the backsliding;• Helping health workers and community leaders communicate actively with caregivers to explain the importance of vaccinations;• Rectifying gaps in immunization coverage, including identifying communities and people who have been missed during the pandemic;• Ensuring that COVID-19 vaccine delivery is independently financed and well-integrated into overall planning for immunization services so that it is not carried out at the cost of childhood and other vaccination services;• Implementing country plans to prevent and respond to outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases and strengthening immunization systems as part of COVID-19 recovery efforts.""

Rosselkhoznadzor announced the possible cause of the outbreak of anthrax in Chuvashia
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The probable cause of the outbreak of anthrax in Chuvashia was the illegal backyard slaughter of an illegally purchased animal. This is stated in the message from Rosselkhoznadzor [the Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance].

""During the investigation into the circumstances of the outbreak of anthrax in the Chuvash Republic, which is being conducted by the territorial department of the Rosselkhoznadzor together with the environmental prosecutor's office, the fact of illegal household slaughter in one of the private farms in the village of Staroye Aktashevo of a bull that is not registered with the veterinary service was established. According to the owner, the animal was purchased on the basis of an advertisement without veterinary accompanying documents. The bull was fed with grain of unknown origin,"" the report says.

According to the Rosselkhoznadzor, vaccination against anthrax was not carried out. The slaughter of the animal was carried out on 3 Mar 2023 due to the deterioration of its health. Veterinary and sanitary pre-slaughter examination was not carried out. Infection of people occurred through cuts on the hands during the processing of the carcass.

The department also noted that the resulting meat and skin were sold to unknown people. The office of the Rosselkhoznadzor turned to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia for the Chuvash Republic to assist in the investigation of the origin of the animal and its movement history. At present, representatives of the Rosselkhoznadzor and the prosecutor's office are on an inspection trip to the personal subsidiary plot in which the specified animal was kept. According to the department, the introduction pathway of the anthrax pathogen and the circumstances of the sale of meat and meat products are being established.

According to the Rosselkhoznadzor, on 16 Mar 2023, an extraordinary meeting of the Government Emergency Anti-Epizootic Commission of the Chuvash Republic will be held to develop a set of measures to eliminate the focus of anthrax in the Tsivilsky municipal district of the Chuvash Republic. Rosselkhoznadzor reminded animal owners of their obligation to take economic and veterinary measures to ensure the prevention of animal diseases and the safety of animal products in veterinary and sanitary terms, to maintain livestock premises and facilities for storing feed and processing animal products in proper condition, and to prevent environmental pollution animal waste.

""Before the arrival of specialists from the State Veterinary Service of the Russian Federation, it is necessary to take measures to isolate animals suspected of having a disease. It is also mandatory to follow the instructions of specialists on taking measures to prevent animal diseases and combat these diseases,"" the message says.

Chuvashia plans to purchase (human) anthrax vaccine
---------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health of Chuvashia plans to conclude a contract for the purchase of anthrax vaccine after the detection of cases of infection in the region. This was reported to TASS on Thursday [16 Mar 2023] by the press service of the republic.

""At the moment, work is underway to purchase anthrax vaccine. A contract for its supply is expected to be concluded in the near future,"" the agency's interlocutor said.

The press service specified that the vaccine will be intended for routine vaccinations of persons whose work is associated with an increased risk of anthrax infection. ""They include agricultural workers, employees of livestock farms, slaughterhouses and meat processing plants, and tanneries. This category of persons also includes employees of wool washing factories, shops for the production of meat, bone meal and bone glue, and veterinarians,"" the agency's interlocutor added.

Chuvash Health Minister Vladimir Stepanov told TASS on Wednesday [15 Mar 2023] that 2 people in the republic were hospitalized with anthrax. They are in a moderate condition. According to the results of an epidemiological investigation, the cause of infection was contact with a butchered bull carcass.

As the head of Chuvash Republic, Oleg Nikolaev, reported, the source of anthrax infection in an animal could be poor-quality compound feed, which the owners most likely purchased from private individuals.

The administration of the Tsivilsky municipal district of Chuvashia, where those infected with anthrax live, reported to TASS that the veterinary service has not yet detected cases of infection in livestock in the district. There are no grounds for introducing quarantine yet.

No cases of anthrax have been detected among animals in Chuvashia
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Employees of the veterinary service did not find any cases of livestock infection in the Tsivilsky municipal district of Chuvashia, where 2 residents had hospitalized with this diagnosis. There are no grounds for introducing quarantine, Ruslan Sayfutdinov, spokesman for the head of the district administration, told TASS on Thursday [16 Mar 2023].

""Employees of the veterinary service are doing all the necessary work in their line, and at the moment there are no facts of anthrax disease in the territory of the Tsivilsky municipal district,"" the agency's interlocutor said.

He clarified that in the personal subsidiary plots of citizens, samples of feed, animal blood, and stomach contents had been taken and sent for examination. ""Today [16 Mar 2023], there are no legal grounds for introducing quarantine in the settlement where patients with a confirmed diagnosis of anthrax live,"" Saifutdinov added.

According to him, information about the sale of infected meat is being checked by law enforcement agencies, all versions are being worked out. ""Today [16 Mar 2023], there is no reason to talk about the risk for consumers, since all the necessary preventive measures have been taken. All services work in close coordination,"" the agency's interlocutor emphasized.

Sayfutdinov added that the residents of the municipal district who had been infected with anthrax were in a stable condition and their lives were not under threat. ""Medical workers continue to monitor contact persons, and on the morning of 16 Mar 2023, there are no new cases of the disease,"" he said.

Chuvash Health Minister Vladimir Stepanov told TASS on Wednesday [15 Mar 2023] that 2 people had been hospitalized with anthrax in the republic. According to him, patients were in a state of moderate severity. On 15 Mar 2023, the press service of the Rospotrebnadzor administration in the republic reported that, according to the results of an epidemiological investigation, contact with a butchered bull carcass was the cause of infection. The head of Chuvash Republic, Oleg Nikolaev, said that the source of anthrax infection could be poor-quality feed, which the owners most likely purchased from private individuals.

[The Russian bureaucracy has produced a flood of words, but I will be brief.

To date (16 Mar 2023) the veterinary service has not found any other sick livestock and do not perceive the necessity to vaccinate the local livestock. So this infected bull was singular. That the authorities are pointing to it being purchased without permission suggests it might have come from an area under anthrax quarantine. So unless it arrived incubating disease it may have been a case of latent anthrax infection. These are known though seldom reported. A useful reference is: Robert S. Gainer, Gilles Vergnaud & Martin E. Hugh-Jones. 2020. A review of arguments for the existence of latent infections of _Bacillus anthracis_, and research needed to understand their role in the outbreaks of anthrax. Microorganisms 2020, 8, 800; doi:10.3390/microorganisms8060800.

That the authorities are organizing a human vaccination program is unusual as this is very expensive and ignores the fact that anthrax is primarily an animal disease which occasionally spills over into humans. Occupational exposure through hides, wool, or hair from infected animals is possible but rarely seen these days. Nowadays, human cases are from slaughtering dead sick livestock. If you vaccinate your livestock, which is straightforward, you prevent both animal and human cases.

If your recognition of this disease is primarily though human cases, you will be missing a large number of livestock outbreaks in which no people were infected and showed clinical signs. Speculatively the livestock outbreaks of anthrax are not being observed. In my experience one sees human cases in the order of 10 livestock outbreaks per single human case. Unexpected livestock deaths will be seen, but if they are not checked for anthrax, the disease goes unobserved.

They still have the possibility of the source of infection being from ""poor quality compound feed"" but the laboratory results of checking samples have not come in yet. - Mod.MHJ

A study published today in the Annals of Internal Medicine suggests a multidrug-resistant bacteria outbreak that killed three hospital patients was likely linked to a commercial water purification system.

The study describes a _Mycobacterium abscessus_ outbreak that occurred at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital from March 2017 to October 2017. The outbreak involved four cardiac surgery patients--two who had bloodstream infections, one with a left ventricular assist device driveline infection, and one with a sternal wound infection. All four patients were treated with multi-agent anti-mycobacterial regimens, and three died. Whole-genome sequencing of _M. abscessus_ isolates from the four patients suggested the infections were closely related.

Investigation into the source of the outbreak led researchers from Brigham and Women's and Harvard Medical School to obtain cultures from sinks and showers in each of the patient's rooms as well as two ice and water machines on the cardiac surgery intensive care unit and a step-down unit. The specimens from the ice machines were both positive for high concentrations of mycobacteria, as were two additional ice machines on the care patients' floor. Direct DNA extraction from ice and water machine samples found an exact match to a gene present in the outbreak samples.

Our cluster demonstrates the risk for unintended consequences associated with systems designed to improve hospital water.
Further investigation revealed that a commercial water purifier with charcoal filters and an ultraviolet irradiation unit that filtered water for one of the hospital's three inpatient towers was depleting chlorine levels, which may have allowed mycobacteria present in the municipal water system (which provides water to the hospital) to colonize that building's ice and water machines. The machines were removed, as was the water purification system, and no additional cases have since been reported.

""Our cluster demonstrates the risk for unintended consequences associated with systems designed to improve hospital water, the predilection of ice and water machines for microbial contamination and the risk this poses to patients, as well as the potential importance of augmenting hospitals' water management programs to monitor and prevent mycobacterial infections in addition to _Legionella_,"" the study authors wrote.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
""Abstract
----------
""Background
Nontuberculous mycobacteria are water-avid pathogens that are associated with nosocomial infections.
""Objective: To describe the analysis and mitigation of a cluster of _Mycobacterium abscessus_ infections in cardiac surgery patients.
""Design: Descriptive study.
""Setting: Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.
""Participants: Four cardiac surgery patients.
""Intervention: Commonalities among cases were sought, potential sources were cultured, patient and environmental specimens were sequenced, and possible sources were abated.
""Measurements: Description of the cluster, investigation, and mitigation.
""Results: Whole-genome sequencing confirmed homology among clinical isolates. Patients were admitted during different periods to different rooms but on the same floor. There were no common operating rooms, ventilators, heater-cooler devices, or dialysis machines. Environmental cultures were notable for heavy mycobacterial growth in ice and water machines on the cluster unit, but little or no growth in ice and water machines in the hospital's other 2 inpatient towers or in shower and sink faucet water in any of the hospital's 3 inpatient towers. Whole-genome sequencing confirmed the presence of a genetically identical element in ice and water machine and patient specimens. Investigation of the plumbing system revealed a commercial water purifier with charcoal filters and an ultraviolet irradiation unit leading to the ice and water machines in the cluster tower but not the hospital's other inpatient towers. Chlorine was present at normal levels in municipal source water but was undetectable downstream from the purification unit. There were no further cases after high-risk patients were switched to sterile and distilled water, ice and water machine maintenance was intensified, and the commercial purification system was decommissioned.
""Limitation: Transmission pathways were not clearly characterized.
""Conclusion: Well-intentioned efforts to modify water management systems may inadvertently increase infection risk for vulnerable patients.""

_Mycobacteroides (formerly _Mycobacterium) abscessus_ is a non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM). NTM are a grouping of acid-fast bacilli separate from the _M. tuberculosis_ complex (<http://www.cdc.gov/hai/organisms/mycobacterium.html>) that differ among themselves on the basis of in vitro growth rate, colonial pigmentation, and molecular diagnostics. Non-pigmented, rapidly growing NTM species (RGM) include the _Mycobacteroides chelonae-abscessus_ group and the_Mycolicibacterium [formerly _Mycobacterium] fortuitum_ complex. RGM produce mature growth on agar plates within 7 days of incubation. More slowly growing NTM include _Mycobacterium marinum_, _M. gordonae_, _M. kansasii_, and the _M. avium/intracellulare_ complex. Other slow growers include _M. ulcerans_, _M. haemophilum_, and _M. simiae_.

NTM are environmental mycobacteria, found in water and soil, which can form biofilms on the inner surfaces of water distribution systems and are resistant to chlorine (<https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2020.00190/full>), constituting a risk for certain people, for example, by microaspiration or by inhalation of aerosols. 

Biofilms form on the inner walls of dental unit waterlines because of the long, small-diameter tubing and low flow rates, resulting in bacteria, such as NTM and Legionella, in dental unit water systems used for irrigating surgical sites and creating aerosols that can be inhaled by the patients. Outbreaks of oro-maxillary and pulmonary infections due to _M. abscessus_ have consequently occurred after pulpotomies at pediatric dentistry (ProMED post Mycobacterium abscessus - USA: (CA) nosocomial, dental, child 20160918.4496529 and <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27054966/>). 
Ice machines are known to promote bacterial growth due to compressors warming the incoming water lines to the machine and this would be a particular concern in healthcare facilities (<https://www.ijmyco.org/article.asp?issn=2212-5531;year=2020;volume=9;issue=4;spage=347;epage=362;aulast=Millar>). For example, ice packs are commonly recommended as part of routine post-operative care following blepharoplasty. Atypical mycobacterium infections have been reported following this surgical procedure and one study demonstrated a significant reduction in the incidence of infection following blepharoplasty by substituting reusable gel packs for ice compresses after an isolated outbreak in North Carolina, suggesting contaminated ice as the source of infection (<https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30124611/>). 
Contaminated water can also contaminate medications and medical instruments. Outbreaks of infections due to RGM have been related to subcutaneous injection of substances contaminated with the bacterium or through invasive medical procedures employing contaminated equipment or implanted devices. Infection can also occur after accidental injury where the wound is contaminated by soil. In addition, _M. abscessus_ is one of the mycobacteria most often isolated from cystic fibrosis patients. In immunocompromised patients, RGM can also cause disseminated infection.

_M. abscessus_ complex consists of 3 subspecies: _M. abscessus_ subsp. _abscessus_, subspecies _bolletii_, and subspecies _massiliense_. The erm(41) gene, which confers macrolide resistance through methylation of 23S ribosomal RNA, is present in the _M. abscessus_ complex group, but many strains of _M. abscessus_ subsp. _massiliense_ have a nonfunctional erm(41) gene, and because of this, the rate of macrolide susceptibility is higher in _M. abscessus_ subsp. _massiliense_ than in the other _M. abscessus_ subsp. (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4550155/>). Because macrolide-resistance can be inducible, strains of _M. abscessus_ initially susceptible can emerge resistant during macrolide therapy. Efflux pumps have also been shown to contribute to macrolide resistance in _M. abscessus_ (<https://www.dovepress.com/efflux-pumps-contribute-to-intrinsic-clarithromycin-resistance-in-clin-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-IDR>).

_M. abscessus_ is also highly resistant to most beta-lactam antibiotics, likely due to its bacterial cell wall biochemistry and a broad-spectrum, chromosomal-encoded Ambler class A beta-lactamase (BlaMab) that is resistant to the beta-lactamase inhibitors clavulanate, tazobactam, and sulbactam (<https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/69/3/691/784297> and <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6167491/>). Of the beta-lactam subclasses, carbapenems have the greatest activity against _M. abscessus_, and among the carbapenems, imipenem has the most activity (<https://jcm.asm.org/content/54/6/1586>). Newer non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitors -- avibactam, relebactam (marketed with imipenem), and vaborbactam (marketed with meropenem) -- improve the activity of carbapenems against _M. abscessus_ (<https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-57844-8> and <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6395916/>). Combinations of different beta-lactam subclasses, such as amoxicillin plus imipenem/relebactam, may be required to fully inhibit peptidoglycan biosynthesis in _M. abscessus_ (<https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-57844-8>).

_M. abscessus_ isolates display in vitro resistance to most oral antibiotics and are generally susceptible to a limited number of parenteral agents, including tigecycline, imipenem, cefoxitin, and amikacin (<https://www.idsociety.org/practice-guideline/nontuberculous-mycobacterial-ntm-diseases/#toc-1>). Current (2020) therapeutic guidelines with respect to pulmonary _M. abscessus_ infection (<https://www.idsociety.org/practice-guideline/nontuberculous-mycobacterial-ntm-diseases/>) suggest multidrug therapy that includes at least 3 active drugs in the initial phase of treatment that often include amikacin and a beta-lactam--imipenem or cefoxitin (guided by in vitro susceptibility testing that includes detection of a functional or nonfunctional erm(41) gene). The duration of therapy, usually more than 12 months, depends on disease severity. Macrolides are very active in vitro against _M. abscessus_ strains without a functional erm(41) gene, and evidence supports their use in patients with disease caused by macrolide-susceptible _M. abscessus_. The 2020 ATS/IDSA guidelines also suggest treatment regimens should be designed in collaboration with experts in the management of these complicated infections. - Mod.ML

.................................................ml/ao/lxl","A study published today in the Annals of Internal Medicine suggests a multidrug-resistant bacteria outbreak that killed three hospital patients was likely linked to a commercial water purification system.The study describes a _Mycobacterium abscessus_ outbreak that occurred at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital from March 2017 to October 2017. The outbreak involved four cardiac surgery patients--two who had bloodstream infections, one with a left ventricular assist device driveline infection, and one with a sternal wound infection. All four patients were treated with multi-agent anti-mycobacterial regimens, and three died. Whole-genome sequencing of _M. abscessus_ isolates from the four patients suggested the infections were closely related.Investigation into the source of the outbreak led researchers from Brigham and Women's and Harvard Medical School to obtain cultures from sinks and showers in each of the patient's rooms as well as two ice and water machines on the cardiac surgery intensive care unit and a step-down unit. The specimens from the ice machines were both positive for high concentrations of mycobacteria, as were two additional ice machines on the care patients' floor. Direct DNA extraction from ice and water machine samples found an exact match to a gene present in the outbreak samples.Our cluster demonstrates the risk for unintended consequences associated with systems designed to improve hospital water.Further investigation revealed that a commercial water purifier with charcoal filters and an ultraviolet irradiation unit that filtered water for one of the hospital's three inpatient towers was depleting chlorine levels, which may have allowed mycobacteria present in the municipal water system (which provides water to the hospital) to colonize that building's ice and water machines. The machines were removed, as was the water purification system, and no additional cases have since been reported.""Our cluster demonstrates the risk for unintended consequences associated with systems designed to improve hospital water, the predilection of ice and water machines for microbial contamination and the risk this poses to patients, as well as the potential importance of augmenting hospitals' water management programs to monitor and prevent mycobacterial infections in addition to _Legionella_,"" the study authors wrote.[Byline: Chris Dall]--Communicated by:ProMED[The citation and abstract for the journal article referenced in the news report above follow:Klompas M, Akusobi C, Boyer J, et al. _Mycobacterium abscessus_ Cluster in Cardiac Surgery Patients Potentially Attributable to a Commercial Water Purification System. Published online 7 March 2023. <https://doi.org/10.7326/M22-3306>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------""Abstract----------""BackgroundNontuberculous mycobacteria are water-avid pathogens that are associated with nosocomial infections.""Objective: To describe the analysis and mitigation of a cluster of _Mycobacterium abscessus_ infections in cardiac surgery patients.""Design: Descriptive study.""Setting: Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.""Participants: Four cardiac surgery patients.""Intervention: Commonalities among cases were sought, potential sources were cultured, patient and environmental specimens were sequenced, and possible sources were abated.""Measurements: Description of the cluster, investigation, and mitigation.""Results: Whole-genome sequencing confirmed homology among clinical isolates. Patients were admitted during different periods to different rooms but on the same floor. There were no common operating rooms, ventilators, heater-cooler devices, or dialysis machines. Environmental cultures were notable for heavy mycobacterial growth in ice and water machines on the cluster unit, but little or no growth in ice and water machines in the hospital's other 2 inpatient towers or in shower and sink faucet water in any of the hospital's 3 inpatient towers. Whole-genome sequencing confirmed the presence of a genetically identical element in ice and water machine and patient specimens. Investigation of the plumbing system revealed a commercial water purifier with charcoal filters and an ultraviolet irradiation unit leading to the ice and water machines in the cluster tower but not the hospital's other inpatient towers. Chlorine was present at normal levels in municipal source water but was undetectable downstream from the purification unit. There were no further cases after high-risk patients were switched to sterile and distilled water, ice and water machine maintenance was intensified, and the commercial purification system was decommissioned.""Limitation: Transmission pathways were not clearly characterized.""Conclusion: Well-intentioned efforts to modify water management systems may inadvertently increase infection risk for vulnerable patients.""_Mycobacteroides (formerly _Mycobacterium) abscessus_ is a non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM). NTM are a grouping of acid-fast bacilli separate from the _M. tuberculosis_ complex (<http://www.cdc.gov/hai/organisms/mycobacterium.html>) that differ among themselves on the basis of in vitro growth rate, colonial pigmentation, and molecular diagnostics. Non-pigmented, rapidly growing NTM species (RGM) include the _Mycobacteroides chelonae-abscessus_ group and the_Mycolicibacterium [formerly _Mycobacterium] fortuitum_ complex. RGM produce mature growth on agar plates within 7 days of incubation. More slowly growing NTM include _Mycobacterium marinum_, _M. gordonae_, _M. kansasii_, and the _M. avium/intracellulare_ complex. Other slow growers include _M. ulcerans_, _M. haemophilum_, and _M. simiae_.NTM are environmental mycobacteria, found in water and soil, which can form biofilms on the inner surfaces of water distribution systems and are resistant to chlorine (<https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2020.00190/full>), constituting a risk for certain people, for example, by microaspiration or by inhalation of aerosols. Biofilms form on the inner walls of dental unit waterlines because of the long, small-diameter tubing and low flow rates, resulting in bacteria, such as NTM and Legionella, in dental unit water systems used for irrigating surgical sites and creating aerosols that can be inhaled by the patients. Outbreaks of oro-maxillary and pulmonary infections due to _M. abscessus_ have consequently occurred after pulpotomies at pediatric dentistry (ProMED post Mycobacterium abscessus - USA: (CA) nosocomial, dental, child 20160918.4496529 and <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27054966/>). Ice machines are known to promote bacterial growth due to compressors warming the incoming water lines to the machine and this would be a particular concern in healthcare facilities (<https://www.ijmyco.org/article.asp?issn=2212-5531;year=2020;volume=9;issue=4;spage=347;epage=362;aulast=Millar>). For example, ice packs are commonly recommended as part of routine post-operative care following blepharoplasty. Atypical mycobacterium infections have been reported following this surgical procedure and one study demonstrated a significant reduction in the incidence of infection following blepharoplasty by substituting reusable gel packs for ice compresses after an isolated outbreak in North Carolina, suggesting contaminated ice as the source of infection (<https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30124611/>). Contaminated water can also contaminate medications and medical instruments. Outbreaks of infections due to RGM have been related to subcutaneous injection of substances contaminated with the bacterium or through invasive medical procedures employing contaminated equipment or implanted devices. Infection can also occur after accidental injury where the wound is contaminated by soil. In addition, _M. abscessus_ is one of the mycobacteria most often isolated from cystic fibrosis patients. In immunocompromised patients, RGM can also cause disseminated infection._M. abscessus_ complex consists of 3 subspecies: _M. abscessus_ subsp. _abscessus_, subspecies _bolletii_, and subspecies _massiliense_. The erm(41) gene, which confers macrolide resistance through methylation of 23S ribosomal RNA, is present in the _M. abscessus_ complex group, but many strains of _M. abscessus_ subsp. _massiliense_ have a nonfunctional erm(41) gene, and because of this, the rate of macrolide susceptibility is higher in _M. abscessus_ subsp. _massiliense_ than in the other _M. abscessus_ subsp. (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4550155/>). Because macrolide-resistance can be inducible, strains of _M. abscessus_ initially susceptible can emerge resistant during macrolide therapy. Efflux pumps have also been shown to contribute to macrolide resistance in _M. abscessus_ (<https://www.dovepress.com/efflux-pumps-contribute-to-intrinsic-clarithromycin-resistance-in-clin-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-IDR>)._M. abscessus_ is also highly resistant to most beta-lactam antibiotics, likely due to its bacterial cell wall biochemistry and a broad-spectrum, chromosomal-encoded Ambler class A beta-lactamase (BlaMab) that is resistant to the beta-lactamase inhibitors clavulanate, tazobactam, and sulbactam (<https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/69/3/691/784297> and <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6167491/>). Of the beta-lactam subclasses, carbapenems have the greatest activity against _M. abscessus_, and among the carbapenems, imipenem has the most activity (<https://jcm.asm.org/content/54/6/1586>). Newer non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitors -- avibactam, relebactam (marketed with imipenem), and vaborbactam (marketed with meropenem) -- improve the activity of carbapenems against _M. abscessus_ (<https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-57844-8> and <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6395916/>). Combinations of different beta-lactam subclasses, such as amoxicillin plus imipenem/relebactam, may be required to fully inhibit peptidoglycan biosynthesis in _M. abscessus_ (<https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-57844-8>)._M. abscessus_ isolates display in vitro resistance to most oral antibiotics and are generally susceptible to a limited number of parenteral agents, including tigecycline, imipenem, cefoxitin, and amikacin (<https://www.idsociety.org/practice-guideline/nontuberculous-mycobacterial-ntm-diseases/#toc-1>). Current (2020) therapeutic guidelines with respect to pulmonary _M. abscessus_ infection (<https://www.idsociety.org/practice-guideline/nontuberculous-mycobacterial-ntm-diseases/>) suggest multidrug therapy that includes at least 3 active drugs in the initial phase of treatment that often include amikacin and a beta-lactam--imipenem or cefoxitin (guided by in vitro susceptibility testing that includes detection of a functional or nonfunctional erm(41) gene). The duration of therapy, usually more than 12 months, depends on disease severity. Macrolides are very active in vitro against _M. abscessus_ strains without a functional erm(41) gene, and evidence supports their use in patients with disease caused by macrolide-susceptible _M. abscessus_. The 2020 ATS/IDSA guidelines also suggest treatment regimens should be designed in collaboration with experts in the management of these complicated infections. - Mod.MLProMED map:Massachusetts, United States: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8708976,224>]",CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) News,,

In Fiji, there has been a surge in leptospirosis cases in the provinces of Macuata and Bua in the Northern Division.

Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease with symptoms including high fever, headache, chills, muscle aches, vomiting, jaundice, and abdominal pain. It is spread through the urine of infected animals.

The Ministry of Health and Medical Services said between 1 Jan 2023 and 26 Feb 2023, there were 171 cases.

The news report above says that the region worst hit by leptospirosis in 2023 has been the Northern Division.

The usual sources of leptospirosis in Fiji have been attributed to flooding with fresh water following heavy rainfall (see also's below). Fiji's wet season is from November to April, with the heaviest rains falling between December and mid-April (<https://www.tourismfiji.com/fiji-weather.html>).

Fiji is an island nation in Melanesia in the South Pacific Ocean about 2000 km (1300 mi) northeast of New Zealand's North Island (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiji>). Fiji is divided into 4 major divisions: Central, Eastern, Northern, and Western. The Northern Division (island of Vanua Levu) has 3 provinces: Bua (located in the west of the northern island of Vanua Levu), Cakaudrove (located in the south-eastern third of the island of Vanua Levu], and Macuata (located in the north-eastern 40 percent of the island of Vanua Levu).

The Government of Dominica is reviewing the treatment for black sigatoka (BS). The disease was first detected in Dominica in July 2012. A banana and plantain unit was established at the Ministry of Agriculture to deal with challenges from BS and to ensure a satisfactory level of production.

A team is currently going around spraying for BS, but plans are to equip and train farmers to do their own spraying. Field sanitation, nutrients for crops, and other cultural practices are also essential for proper management of the disease.

In 2017, Dominica welcomed a team of French technicians to advise on methods to combat the fungus affecting the country's banana crops. The objective of the cooperation is to control BS, as well as to reduce the use of pesticides. The French team proposed a series of trials on approaches to fight BS so that crops can be sold and exported on local, regional, and international levels.

[Black sigatoka (BS), also known as black leaf streak, is caused by the fungus _Pseudocercospora fijiensis_ (previously _Mycosphaerella fijiensis_). It only affects species and hybrids of _Musa_, which include bananas and plantains (cooking bananas). Worldwide, BS is one of the most devastating leaf diseases of bananas, with yield losses of 50% or more. It is present in the Americas, China, Southeast Asia, and parts of Africa. Infection occurs on the youngest leaves of the plant; older leaves are not readily infected. BS seriously affects photosynthetic ability and plant vigour. Fruit can ripen prematurely during commercial shipment, causing further losses.

The fungus is spread by water and wind and with contaminated materials (including suckers for planting). Disease management may include frequent applications of fungicides, phytosanitary measures to reduce inoculum, as well as cultural practices. However, high costs of some measures may make them unavailable to smallholders. Furthermore, resistances to frequently used fungicides have been reported as emerging in different global populations (see link below). Use of agrochemicals may also cause problems for fruit export, for example to Europe. BS is another example of a warm climate disease spreading due to global climate change (see links below).

Related fungi cause yellow sigatoka (YS; sigatoka leaf spot; _P. musae_) and eumusa leaf spot (_P. eumusae_). Symptoms and epidemiology are similar for all 3. YS is more adapted to cooler temperatures; less damage is caused to photosynthetic tissue. There are more crop cultivars with degrees of resistance to YS than to BS.

BS (and also YS) has been causing serious crop losses in the Caribbean and continues to spread there, despite some national quarantine measures (e.g., ProMED post 20100204.0381). This would suggest that a regional approach is likely to be the best control option, especially since wind-borne spores may spread between neighbouring islands.

First detected in Canada in 2019 in Ontario, _Tomato brown rugose fruit virus_ (ToBRFV) hit hard again throughout the last 2022/23 growing season in southwestern Ontario tomato crops, leading to yield losses and the destruction of large amounts of produce. Glasshouse growers are struggling to develop a tomato variety resistant to this fast-spreading virus. ToBRFV is a global issue that can quickly affect yields and farming operations.

[_Tomato brown rugose fruit virus_ (ToBRFV) was recently identified as a new member of the genus _Tobamovirus_ (type member _Tobacco mosaic virus_, TMV) in Jordan and soon after in Israel (see update links below). Since then, it has also been reported from Europe and the Mediterranean region, where it continues to spread (see links below), as well as from North America and China. It was shown to also affect capsicum and has been detected in both plants and seeds of both crops. ToBRFV symptoms on tomato vary depending on host cultivar but may include chlorosis, mottling, mosaic, and crinkling (rugosis) on leaves; necrotic spots on petioles and calyces; and yellowish mottling, brown spots, and rugosis on fruit to make them unmarketable. On capsicum, leaf symptoms are similar; fruits may be deformed with yellow mottling or green stripes. Almost 100% incidence was reported for some outbreaks in tomato, but not every fruit on an infected plant may show symptoms.

ToBRFV (like many tobamoviruses) is seed transmitted and can also be spread by mechanical means, contaminated equipment, as well as with plant or other materials. It is very stable and can remain infectious for months outside a host. Recently, bumblebees, which are used widely as commercial pollinators in glasshouse tomato production, have been shown to be effective vectors of ToBRFV (see link below). Volunteer crop plants and solanaceous weed species are likely pathogen reservoirs. The Tm-22 resistance gene used in some tomato cultivars to protect from other tobamoviruses (such as _Tomato mosaic virus_) does not appear to be effective against ToBRFV. Disease management relies mainly on exclusion but may include phytosanitation (disinfecting tools, removing crop debris) and control of virus reservoirs. Use of certified clean seeds or crop transplants is crucial. Research on possible seed treatments to eliminate the virus is being carried out (see link below). Tomato seeds are traded widely and are known to pose a risk of spreading viruses and other pathogens internationally (e.g., ProMED post 20140122.2222560).

Coinfection of ToBRFV with _Pepino mosaic virus_ (genus _Potexvirus_) and _Tomato spotted wilt virus_ (genus _Orthotospovirus_) have been found in tomato (ProMED posts 20191029.6751082, 20200507.7307615). It is thought that the respective symptoms may have been due to either virus or synergism. Further research is needed to clarify a potential role of ToBRFV in coinfections and to determine whether its presence in coinfections may have led to earlier cases of misdiagnosis and delayed identification of this new virus.

[The European Commission for the Control of Foot-and-Mouth Disease (EuFMD) and FAO's Emergency Prevention System (EMPRES) launched on Tuesday [14 Mar 2023] the symposium ""Lumpy Skin Disease: How science can support disease management and control.""  The hybrid meeting (virtual and in FAO headquarters, Rome) is being held 14-16 Mar 2023.

Here we present some of the data presented by Indonesia, LSD's most recently infected country. The presentation took place during the 2nd day of the event, Wed 15 Mar 2023. - Mod.AS]

1. Monthly number of new LSD outbreaks/cases since the start of the event:
2022: February 58/152, March 107/211, April 377/900, May 584/2951, June 702/5193, July 223/1330, August 567/1744, September 438/1563, October 247/778, November 327/1510, December 352/1171. 2023: January 1700/4315, February 2396/7168 (updated 27 Feb 2023).
2. Monthly number of vaccinations since the start of the project:
2022: March 6370, April 16 367, May 6847, June 4926, July 3650, August 2956, September 17 124, October 16 611, November 74 526, December 55 951. 2023: January 33 501, February 10 367.

Vaccinations: The vaccinations started March 2022. Total number of doses, applied in 9 provinces as of 27 Feb 2023, is 249 196 (updated 27 Feb 2023).

3. Recently, reported LSD cases are increasing, especially when it spread to Java Island where most of the susceptible population is present.

4. Main challenges encountered:
- Extensive animal farming system
- Illegal animal movement
- Limited number of officers to implement vaccination
- High workload for FMD control activities (vaccination, animal identification), affecting the LSD control.
[For each of the above, recommended solutions were presented.]

On 8 Dec 2022, Australian sources reported its spread to East Java, including the environs of Malang, the capital of Java's main dairy district. The spread of LSD to Java, synchronic with the spread of foot-and-mouth disease, are a matter of grave concern for Australia. The Australian government and industry support Indonesia's efforts to contain both murrains.

During the 1st 2 days of the above meeting, the following sessions were held:
1. Current status and advances in epidemiological knowledge on LSD;
2. Combatting LSD in different farming scenarios (transmission pathways and risk monitoring and challenges).

Tomorrow's (Thu 16 Mar 2023) sessions are dedicated to the following issues:
Session 1: Vaccines and vaccination strategies (3 papers);
Session 2: Diagnostics (6 papers); final recommendations and conclusions.

The press service of the Department of Rospotrebnadzor for the Chuvash Republic revealed the source of infection of 2 people with anthrax. According to the regional department, the cause of infection was contact with raw meat when butchering a bull carcass.

""Samples of environmental objects were taken to determine the source of infection, pathways and transmission factors. According to the results of the epidemiological investigation, the cause of infection was contact with animal raw materials -- a butchered carcass of a bull. Disinfection was carried out in the hearth, medical supervision of contact persons was established,"" -- is stated in the message on the website of Rospotrebnadzor for Chuvashia.

Earlier, the governor of the republic reported 2 detected cases of anthrax infection. He noted that the patients were hospitalized in moderate severity and their lives are not in danger. No infected people have been identified among those who came into contact with them, but they are all under medical supervision.

Earlier, the Telegram channel Mash reported that those infected were a married couple. According to the source, the husband became infected when he injured his hand while cutting a bull. It is also noted that about 500-600 kg (1100-1320 lb) of meat managed to be sold.

""Presumably to gypsies on the highway. Where they migrated to, whether they stayed in the region, and where half a ton of meat with anthrax is now is unknown,"" - Mash reports.

According to the publication, the infection of livestock occurred through purchased feed, the origin of which is being investigated by the Rosselkhoznadzor.

[Two lessons from this Russian outbreak:
1. Never dismiss cutaneous anthrax lesions. They can turn nasty and do in around 19% of cases. They respond very well to antibiotic treatment.
2. Thanks to bovine spongiform encephalopathy, we see very few livestock cases these days from bone meal and such, but it is still possible, and Russia has reported outbreaks from bone meal in the past. Though rare, outbreaks have occurred through contaminated silage and hay. Chuvashia is off on its own, and present-day regulations might not be as strictly observed as elsewhere in Russia. This province reports very few anthrax outbreaks; therefore, it might be missing them when they occur, and dead animals could go for rendering and the bones end up in bone meal. The source is under investigation, and we should hear in due course what they find out. - Mod.MHJ

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: in the epidemiological unit, mortality began to increase slightly on 10 Mar 2023 (0.34%), increasing on 11 Mar 2023 (0.65%). On 12 Mar 2023, there was a greater increase than on the previous days (3.16%), and the company notified the SAG. The SAG confirms avian influenza type A by PCR Matrix type A on day 12 at 22:00 hours. The stamping out begins the same night of 12 Mar 2023. On 13 Mar 2023, highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 is confirmed by PCR and sequencing. The stamping out of all birds in the epidemiological unit ends on the evening of 13 Mar 2023. Two zones have been established, an infected zone of 3 kilometers (1.86 mi) and a surveillance zone of 7 kilometers (4.35 mi), to complete a radius of 10 kilometers (6.21 mi) around the outbreak. Within these zones, the sanitary measures described in the current avian influenza contingency plan will be applied. Poultry and backyard (non-poultry) establishments will be included in the surveillance. This sanitary event is related to event 4775 in wild birds (from December 2022) and backyard birds (non-poultry) (February 2023), which is still ongoing in the country.

Panamanian health authorities today [14 Mar 2023] intensify preventive actions to combat malaria, given the worrying rise in cases. Reports from the Department of Epidemiology of the Ministry of Health (Minsa) indicate that as of 7 Mar 2023, a total of 1922 cases of malaria were recorded in the country, a disease caused by the _Plasmodium_ parasite and transmitted by the _Anopheles_ mosquito.

The reason for the increase in patients is multifactorial, but above all is a result of a decrease in compliance with the programs caused by the confinement that COVID-19 forced, according to the Minsa. As a result of the health crisis since 2020, it was not possible to recruit on personal time, or to acquire the supplies, because the budget was allocated to the contingency due to the pandemic.

The researcher and entomologist Lorenzo Cáceres explained to the press that in the last 10 years until 2018 an annual average of 646 cases of malaria were reported, but from 2019 to date an annual average of 3764 has been registered.

Cáceres opined that the increase is also due to the change in the insecticide fenitrothion, which according to a recent study by the Gorgas Institute was killing 80% of mosquitoes up to the 5th month of its application. That insecticide was replaced in 2018 by sumishield, which was not previously evaluated.

In this sense, the Executive adopted other measures such as the creation last January of an operation center against malaria, that is, an intersectoral table led by the Minister of Health, Luis Francisco Sucre, for the management of the disease. In addition, to reduce the risk of cases, bed nets and hammocks have been delivered to the native communities of Wacuco, Río Rubén, Igarwala and Tortí Medio abajo.

Most malaria cases are registered in the Guna Yala region, Darién, Ngäbe Buglé region and eastern Panama. Epidemiology reports show that last year [2022] there were more than double the number of malaria cases than in 2021, since 7112 were reported, that is, 3469 more than in 2021, when the figure was 3643.

[In the WHO Region of the Americas, as well as worldwide, there has been a marked increase in malaria cases and deaths since 2019, and much of this is attributable to disruptions in malaria prevention, diagnosis, and treatment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic (WHO World Malaria Report 2021; <https://www.who.int/teams/global-malaria-programme/reports/world-malaria-report-2021>). The Panama Ministry of Health (MINSA) registered 6087 cases of malaria in 2020, more than any prior year since 2000.

As discussed in the most recent post about malaria in Panama (below in the See Also section), Guna Yala has the highest incidence of malaria of any region in Panama, even though it has one of the lowest populations. This may be due in part to its long coastline and other climactic conditions, but it is also a relatively remote autonomous region where access to health services is limited.

The Minas Gerais State Health Secretariat (SES-MG) confirmed a death due to yellow fever in Monte Santo de Minas (MG). The death from the disease in the city was reported by the state this Tuesday [14 Mar 2023].

According to SES-MG, the victim is a 41-year-old man [vaccinated? - Mod. RNA], a rural worker, who died on 23 Feb 2023.

With the confirmation of a fatal case in the state, SES-MG announced that there will be an epidemiological investigation to determine the probable site of infection, whether it was exported from São Paulo or indigenous to Minas Gerais. SES also pointed out that there will be a meeting to align actions with municipalities and regional health units in Passos and Alfenas to delineate the actions that will be developed with the support of the state. In addition, SES said it will intensify the actions of immunization to increase vaccination coverage against yellow fever.

On 27 Jan 2023, the state of São Paulo recorded the 1st confirmed case of yellow fever since 2020. This case was in a 73-year-old man, a resident of a rural area in the municipality of Vargem Grande do Sul in the interior of São Paulo.

Due to a number of cases confirmed in the last 3 weeks, as of 9 Mar 2023, Alberta Health Services (AHS) has reopened the _Shigella_ outbreak that is impacting Edmonton Zone inner-city residents. In the 3 weeks following the outbreak's closure, 5 new cases were identified, all of whom required hospitalization. Even with heightened public health surveillance for illness, we recognize there are cases that go undetected and given case numbers are rising again, AHS is acting in the interest of public health by reopening the outbreak.

The 1st person became ill on 17 Aug 2022 with a confirmed diagnosis on 29 Aug 2022, and an outbreak was declared on 8 Sep 2022. It was initially declared over on 16 Feb 2023, following 2 weeks of no new cases. Closure of an outbreak following 2 weeks of no new cases is standard practice. To date [10 Mar 2023], we have identified 211 people with _Shigella_, 144 of which have required hospitalization. No deaths have been reported connected to this outbreak.

Shigellosis is a disease that is commonly associated with diarrhea, as well as fever, nausea and stomach cramps. It can cause severe illness, resulting in hospitalization, and it spreads when someone comes into contact with fecal matter from an infected person and also by eating food contaminated with the bacteria.

AHS' response to this outbreak began immediately following the 1st confirmed case, and that work involves connecting with shelters, inner-city agencies, and local family physicians about the ongoing situation. In early October 2022, AHS reached out to the City of Edmonton for support, and in mid-October AHS struck a task force to coordinate resources and a response between inner-city community partners. That task force continues to meet. Going forward, the task force will discuss additional options for limiting the spread of illness and the possibility of carrying out another medical outreach effort in the inner-city to boost access to testing and treatment.

The majority of the cases to date are within the city's inner-city population, so the risk to the general public remains low. As always, we would like to remind the general public that proper hand hygiene helps prevent the spread of any illnesses, including _Shigella_.

Alberta Health Services is the provincial health authority responsible for planning and delivering health supports and services for more than 4 million adults and children living in Alberta. Our mission is to provide a patient-focused, quality health system that is accessible and sustainable for all Albertans. Our current focus is on reducing emergency department wait-times, improving EMS response times, increasing access to surgeries, and improving patient flow.

[_Shigella_ was discovered more than 100 years ago by the Japanese microbiologist Kiyoshi Shiga, for whom the genus is named. There are 4 species: _S. boydii_, _S. dysenteriae_, _S. flexneri_, and _S. sonnei_. _Shigella_ organisms can survive transit through the stomach because they are less susceptible to acid than other bacteria; for this reason, as few as 10-100 organisms can cause disease. Ingested bacteria pass into the small intestine where they multiply; large numbers of bacteria then pass into the colon, where they enter the colonic cells. Given its relatively low infectious dose, transmission can occur via contaminated food and water or via direct person-to-person spread, including sexual practices commoner in men who have sex with men. Humans are the only natural reservoir for the disease.

The bacterium is the classical cause of bacterial dysentery (formerly known as flux or the bloody flux), an inflammatory disorder of the colon, which results in severe diarrhea containing mucus and/or blood in the feces with fever, abdominal pain, and rectal tenesmus (pain while passing diarrhea).

Summary
------
""Shigellosis is a clinical syndrome caused by invasion of the epithelium lining the terminal ileum, colon, and rectum by _Shigella_ species. Although infections occur globally, and in people of all ages, endemic infections among children aged 1-4 years living in low-income and middle-income settings constitute most of the disease burden. The versatile manifestations of these highly contagious organisms range from acute watery diarrhoea to fulminant dysentery characterised by frequent scant bloody stools with fever, prostration, and abdominal cramps. A broad array of uncommon, but often severe, intestinal and extraintestinal complications can occur. Despite marked reductions in mortality during the past 3 decades, there are roughly 164 000 annual deaths attributable to shigellosis. Intercontinental dissemination of multiresistant shigella strains, facilitated by travellers and men who have sex with men, has prompted new recommendations for antibiotic therapy. Awareness of disease burden and the emerging threats posed by shigella have accelerated interest in development of shigella vaccines, many of which are being tested in clinical trials.""

Since late February 2023 and as of 10 Mar 2023, 67 cases of botulism linked to intragastric injection of the botulism neurotoxin (BoNT) have been reported in Germany (12), Austria (1), Switzerland (1) and Turkey (53). The information currently available indicates that all patients had medical interventions aimed at helping them lose weight performed between 22 Feb 2023 and 1 Mar 2023. Among 63 cases with available information, 60 cases are linked to a private hospital in Istanbul while 3 cases are linked to a private hospital in Izmir, Turkey. The symptoms have ranged from mild to severe, and several cases have been hospitalized. Among those hospitalized, a number are reported to have been admitted to intensive care units (ICU) and received treatment with botulinum antitoxin.

Individuals who have travelled to Istanbul and Izmir for intragastric BoNT treatment between 22 Feb 2023 and 1 Mar 2023 are encouraged to seek medical advice from their healthcare provider, particularly if they experience symptoms such as weakness, difficulty in breathing and/or swallowing.

ECDC strongly encourages EU/EEA citizens to avoid intragastric treatments with BoNT for obesity in Turkey, as this is currently associated with a significant risk of developing botulism. At this time, it is unclear whether this event represents a therapeutic or procedural issue in the involved hospitals, or whether there is a problem with the product administered. Investigations carried out by Turkish authorities revealed that licensed BoNT products were administered in the treatments but that these products are not approved for the treatment of obesity by intragastric injection. Consequently, the relevant departments of both hospitals have had their activities suspended, and investigations have been launched against the parties involved.

Botulism is a serious neuroparalytic illness caused by BoNTs mainly produced by the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_. The disease naturally occurs in 4 different forms:

- Food-borne botulism, caused by eating food containing BoNTs
- Intestinal botulism, when botulinum spores germinate within the intestine of adult persons
- Infant botulism, when botulinum spores germinate within the intestine of babies under one year of age
- Wound botulism, when a wound gets contaminated by botulinum spores which then germinate

There are 2 other forms of botulism that do not occur naturally: inhalation botulism and iatrogenic botulism, of which the latter may occur as an adverse event following the administration of BoNTs for therapeutic or cosmetic reasons.

While it is considered rare, individuals receiving BoNT injections for cosmetic purposes (for example, for facial wrinkle lines) or therapeutic treatments (for example, management of muscle spasticity) may develop botulism if they are injected with an excessive dose of the BoNTs.

Symptoms of iatrogenic botulism include weakness and fatigue. Toxicities following cosmetic treatment can include blurred vision, drooping eyelids, difficulty in swallowing, and dry mouth, while toxicities following therapeutic treatments include difficulty in breathing, indicating an administration of an overdose.

The symptoms of botulism can be very severe requiring intensive-care treatment as well as the administration of botulinum antitoxin. Even when such treatments are available, complete recovery usually takes weeks to months. Limited information is available quantifying mortality in botulism cases caused by medical interventions. For food-borne botulism, 5-10% of cases are fatal.

The number of cases in Germany (where the outbreak was first reported), Austria and Switzerland has not increased since the ECDC report on 10 Mar 2023; however, not surprisingly, cases -- indeed a formidable number -- are now reported from Turkey itself. In addition, a 2nd site has been reported where the procedure produced botulism. As the ECDC report states, it is unclear whether this event represents a therapeutic or procedural issue in the involved facilities, or whether there is a problem with the product administered. Additionally, as discussed in the previous post on the outbreak (Botulism - Europe: ex Turkey, iatrogenic, ECDC 20230314.8708929), it remains unclear what the efficacy is for this procedure in producing weight loss in humans. - Mod.LL

.................................................sb/ll/rd/lxl","Since late February 2023 and as of 10 Mar 2023, 67 cases of botulism linked to intragastric injection of the botulism neurotoxin (BoNT) have been reported in Germany (12), Austria (1), Switzerland (1) and Turkey (53). The information currently available indicates that all patients had medical interventions aimed at helping them lose weight performed between 22 Feb 2023 and 1 Mar 2023. Among 63 cases with available information, 60 cases are linked to a private hospital in Istanbul while 3 cases are linked to a private hospital in Izmir, Turkey. The symptoms have ranged from mild to severe, and several cases have been hospitalized. Among those hospitalized, a number are reported to have been admitted to intensive care units (ICU) and received treatment with botulinum antitoxin.Individuals who have travelled to Istanbul and Izmir for intragastric BoNT treatment between 22 Feb 2023 and 1 Mar 2023 are encouraged to seek medical advice from their healthcare provider, particularly if they experience symptoms such as weakness, difficulty in breathing and/or swallowing.ECDC strongly encourages EU/EEA citizens to avoid intragastric treatments with BoNT for obesity in Turkey, as this is currently associated with a significant risk of developing botulism. At this time, it is unclear whether this event represents a therapeutic or procedural issue in the involved hospitals, or whether there is a problem with the product administered. Investigations carried out by Turkish authorities revealed that licensed BoNT products were administered in the treatments but that these products are not approved for the treatment of obesity by intragastric injection. Consequently, the relevant departments of both hospitals have had their activities suspended, and investigations have been launched against the parties involved.Botulism is a serious neuroparalytic illness caused by BoNTs mainly produced by the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_. The disease naturally occurs in 4 different forms:- Food-borne botulism, caused by eating food containing BoNTs- Intestinal botulism, when botulinum spores germinate within the intestine of adult persons- Infant botulism, when botulinum spores germinate within the intestine of babies under one year of age- Wound botulism, when a wound gets contaminated by botulinum spores which then germinateThere are 2 other forms of botulism that do not occur naturally: inhalation botulism and iatrogenic botulism, of which the latter may occur as an adverse event following the administration of BoNTs for therapeutic or cosmetic reasons.While it is considered rare, individuals receiving BoNT injections for cosmetic purposes (for example, for facial wrinkle lines) or therapeutic treatments (for example, management of muscle spasticity) may develop botulism if they are injected with an excessive dose of the BoNTs.Symptoms of iatrogenic botulism include weakness and fatigue. Toxicities following cosmetic treatment can include blurred vision, drooping eyelids, difficulty in swallowing, and dry mouth, while toxicities following therapeutic treatments include difficulty in breathing, indicating an administration of an overdose.The symptoms of botulism can be very severe requiring intensive-care treatment as well as the administration of botulinum antitoxin. Even when such treatments are available, complete recovery usually takes weeks to months. Limited information is available quantifying mortality in botulism cases caused by medical interventions. For food-borne botulism, 5-10% of cases are fatal.--Communicated by:ProMED[This information was also contributed by Chris Dall.The number of cases in Germany (where the outbreak was first reported), Austria and Switzerland has not increased since the ECDC report on 10 Mar 2023; however, not surprisingly, cases -- indeed a formidable number -- are now reported from Turkey itself. In addition, a 2nd site has been reported where the procedure produced botulism. As the ECDC report states, it is unclear whether this event represents a therapeutic or procedural issue in the involved facilities, or whether there is a problem with the product administered. Additionally, as discussed in the previous post on the outbreak (Botulism - Europe: ex Turkey, iatrogenic, ECDC 20230314.8708929), it remains unclear what the efficacy is for this procedure in producing weight loss in humans. - Mod.LLProMED maps:Turkey: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8708949,87>Europe: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8708949,6010>]",European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC),,

In a follow-up on the carbapenemase-producing organisms (CPO) detected in Denmark, the Statens Serum Institut (SSI) has detected 2 more cases of multi-resistant bacteria in patients who have been treated with the drug Dicillin [dicloxicillin brand].

In addition, traces of the special multiresistant CPO bacterium have been found in a further 12 patients, of whom it has been confirmed that 8 have been treated with Dicillin in the period before the discovery. The remaining 4 cases are still being investigated.

Thus, the outbreak with the bacterial strain now includes a total of 25 cases, as 11 cases had previously been identified.

The case of the multi-resistant bacteria and the drug Dicillin began when, in October 2022, the SSI registered an increase in a special multi-resistant CPO bacterium that had not been seen before. On closer examination, the increase in bacteria could not be related to infection in hospitals or travel abroad but was detected last month [February 2023] on the surface of capsules of the medicine Dicillin. It also turned out that all the patients had taken the medicine up to the detection of the bacteria.

SSI is following the outbreak closely and the Danish Medicines Agency is working with the manufacturer [Sandoz] to uncover the causes of the outbreak.

None of the Danish patients have become seriously ill from the bacteria, just as it has not been necessary to initiate other treatments for the bacteria. ""This is not dangerous for the individual patient, but we must of course do what we can to avoid the spread of multi-resistant bacteria,"" professional director at SSI, Tyra Grove Krause. says and continues: ""We know that most CPO bacteria have the ability to share their resistance with other bacterial species, so that part is not so surprising.""

[Dicillin is a brand name for dicloxacillin marketed in Denmark, an orally administered beta-lactam antibiotic of the penicillin class that is active against Gram-positive cocci, including methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and streptococci, including beta-lactamase (penicillinase)-producing _Staphylococcus aureus_ that are resistant to penicillin (ie, methicillin-susceptible _S. aureus_ (MSSA). However, methicillin-resistant _S. aureus_ (MRSA) are resistant to dicloxacillin.

The reports above say that there are now 25 patients (who are not related) who were colonized (but not infected) by the same carbapenemase-positive organism (""CPO""), now identified as _Enterobacter hormaechei_ sequence type 79, in the past 4 months (October 2022 to March 2023) in Denmark. 21 of these patients had been treated with Dicillin® (500 mg capsules) from the pharmaceutical company Sandoz. The remaining 4 cases are still being investigated. _E. hormaechei_ sequence type 79 has been identified on the surface of a capsule of Dicillin® 500 mg taken from previously unopened packages of Dicillin®.

In addition, one person in Iceland who had taken dicloxacillin manufactured by Sandoz (Staklox® brand in Iceland) in July 2022 has been said to have developed an ""infection"" with the same bacterium identified in the 25 patients in Denmark. Also, this organism was isolated from 2 patients in 2020 in Denmark who had taken Dicillin® shortly before isolation of _E. hormaechei_ sequence type 79.

It is likely that several lots of dicloxacillin manufactured by Sandoz, called Dicillin® in Denmark and Staklox® in Iceland, have been contaminated since affected patients are located in 2 different European countries, and dates of exposure extend from 2020 to 2023. All dicloxacillin is being recalled by Sandoz in Denmark and Iceland. However, we are not told which lots of dicloxacillin are affected, where the affected lots of the drug were manufactured and bottled, or how widely these lots have been distributed.

More information on this outbreak would be greatly appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML

Within the last 2 weeks [1st half of March 2023], 4 dead skunks found in Larimer County [Colorado] have tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, marking a growing trend of the deadly disease showing up in mammals in Colorado.

The county's 4 deaths are the most HPAI mammal deaths in the state.

HPAI has devastated domestic poultry operations and killed countless wild waterfowl and raptors in Colorado and elsewhere in one of the most deadly outbreaks in years. In Colorado, it was first detected in the wild population in geese, in March 2022.

""We always suspected this transition (from wild waterfowl to mammals) would happen,'' Colorado Parks and Wildlife spokesperson Kara Van Hoose said. ""Because it's so new and science takes time, we don't know what kind of impacts it will have. The number of fatalities doesn't cause alarms to go off but we certainly are testing and monitoring.''

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers the risk of transmission to humans, pets, and wild mammals as low.

Colorado Parks and Wildlife confirmed the positive tests, 1 on 2 Mar 2023 and 3 on 28 Feb 2023, but would not identify where in the county the skunks were located. It began testing for mammals on 9 Feb 2023.

Among the mammal deaths in Colorado are 5 skunks, 4 mountain lions, 2 bobcats, 2 red foxes, and 1 black bear, according to the US Department of Agriculture's website that tracks such deaths. Nationally, red foxes are by far the most impacted mammal, representing 60 of the 144 confirmed mammal deaths as of 9 Mar 2023.

Colorado is tied for 4th in mammal deaths due to the disease. Wisconsin is 1st, with 19 deaths.

Testing has confirmed 8 skunks found dead in late February [2023] in Richmond and Vancouver [British Columbia] are positive for avian influenza.

The skunks were found in residential areas in both cities and were taken to BC's Animal Health Centre due to concerns they may have been deliberately poisoned. Testing revealed the skunks were infected with the same strain of H5N1 avian influenza that caused the deaths of wildlife and domestic poultry in the province since the April 2022 outbreak began. The skunks may have contracted influenza by scavenging infected wild birds.

While influenza in skunks is considered to be a low risk to human health, there are always risks when people and pets come into contact with sick or dead wild animals, including skunks and birds. People who encounter a dead skunk in Richmond or Vancouver should leave the animal where it is and contact the BC Wildlife Health Program at 250 751-7246.

Since April 2022, wildlife infected by avian influenza in BC has included more than 20 species of wild birds, as well as 2 skunks and one fox found in rural areas of the province.

The cases of H5N1 avian influenza in BC are part of a larger national and international outbreak.

Infections by HPAI viruses in mammals were typically not common, but since April 2022 there has been a growing number of events of Eurasian HPAI H5N1 in a wide spectrum of wild carnivores (order Carnivora). There have been reports in red foxes (_Vulpes vulpes_, family Canidae), bobcats and mountain lions (family Felidae), skunks (family Mephitidae), raccoons (family Procyonidae), bears (family Ursidae), otters and minks (family Mustelidae), seals and sea lions (suborder Pinnipedia, families Phocidae and Otariidae, respectively). There have also been cases in cetaceans.

Molecular analyses of mammalian virus strains revealed mutations in the PB2 gene segment (PB2-E627K and PB2-D701N) that are known to facilitate viral replication in mammals. However, these mutations were not present in the strain that killed hundreds of sea lions in Peru. - Mod.PMB]

.................................................sb/pmb/mj/lxl","Testing has confirmed 8 skunks found dead in late February [2023] in Richmond and Vancouver [British Columbia] are positive for avian influenza.The skunks were found in residential areas in both cities and were taken to BC's Animal Health Centre due to concerns they may have been deliberately poisoned. Testing revealed the skunks were infected with the same strain of H5N1 avian influenza that caused the deaths of wildlife and domestic poultry in the province since the April 2022 outbreak began. The skunks may have contracted influenza by scavenging infected wild birds.While influenza in skunks is considered to be a low risk to human health, there are always risks when people and pets come into contact with sick or dead wild animals, including skunks and birds. People who encounter a dead skunk in Richmond or Vancouver should leave the animal where it is and contact the BC Wildlife Health Program at 250 751-7246.Since April 2022, wildlife infected by avian influenza in BC has included more than 20 species of wild birds, as well as 2 skunks and one fox found in rural areas of the province.The cases of H5N1 avian influenza in BC are part of a larger national and international outbreak.--Communicated by:ProMED[ProMED map of British Columbia, Canada: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8708945,264>Infections by HPAI viruses in mammals were typically not common, but since April 2022 there has been a growing number of events of Eurasian HPAI H5N1 in a wide spectrum of wild carnivores (order Carnivora).

Viet Nam's health ministry has urged medical facilities to be vigilant for suspected cases of _Streptococcus suis_, a bacterium that comes from pigs, after a number of human cases were found over the past few months, local media reported on Tuesday [14 Mar 2023].

Since the beginning of the year [2023], several _Streptococcus_ infections have been recorded across the nation and the majority of cases have involved people eating pork products such as blood pudding, or those who slaughter pigs, the Vietnam News reported, citing the health ministry.

Patients often suffer severe clinical symptoms and need long-term, expensive treatment. Once people become infected with the virus [_S. suis_ is a bacterium, not a virus], the disease develops quickly, leading to complications such as septic shock, coma, and multiple organ failure.

The ministry's Department of Preventive Medicine has called on local health authorities to strengthen supervision to early detect suspected cases of infections and have measures to handle the outbreak. People were urged to cook pork properly in order to eliminate the potential risk of infection, as no vaccination against the disease is available at the moment.

A report from the ministry's infectious disease surveillance system showed that in the 1st months of this year [2023], a number of _Streptococcus_ infections were recorded across the nation.

The Medical Centre of Sóc Sơn District in Hà Nội reported that it has successfully saved a patient suffering from anaphylactic [?] shock after eating blood pudding. [The 51-year-old], residing in Phù Linh Commune, was admitted to the hospital with red skin, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and high blood pressure. The patient said he had no allergies and had a good health record.

On 1 Mar 2023, doctors at Bãi Cháy Hospital received a Chinese patient suffering from a fever. The patient tested positive for _Streptococcus suis_. He is now in stable health condition after 12 days of treatment.

The 1st human cases of _Streptococcus suis_ were recorded last month [February 2023] when a 52-year-old resident of Hà Đông District, who was the owner of a restaurant that sells blood pudding, was infected with the virus [_S. suis_ is a bacterium, not a virus]. The man underwent examination at 103 Military Hospital are suffering from high fever, nausea, and vomiting.

The ministry said that the majority of cases have involved people eating pork products such as blood pudding, or those who slaughter pigs. Patients often suffer severe clinical symptoms ad need long-term, expensive treatment. Once people become infected with the [bacterium], the disease develops quickly, leading to complications such as septic shock, coma, and multiple organ failure.

In 1960, the 1st human case was detected and since then there have been around 490 human cases of _S. suis_, of which the mortality rate stands at 17.5 per cent.

In Viet Nam, about 10 patients have been admitted to the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases in the past several years.

According to a study by the HCM City-based Hospital for Tropical Diseases, this disease is more prevalent during hot weather. The majority of patients are farmers who are exposed to pork products or pig slaughtering. Most of the patients had meningitis symptoms such as fever, headache, vomiting, stiff neck, and impaired consciousness.

To prevent the disease, the ministry's Department of Preventive Medicine has called on local health authorities to strengthen supervision to early detect suspected cases of infections and have measures to handle the outbreak.

They have also advised people to stop eating blood pudding and cook pork meat properly in order to eliminate the potential risk of infection, as no vaccination against the disease is available at the moment. Furthermore, people should avoid the purchase, transport, or slaughter of sick or dead pigs and use protective gloves when in contact with pigs.

[_Streptococcus suis_ is an alpha-hemolytic Gram-positive coccus growing in chains on blood agar. It has a worldwide distribution. _S. suis_ is divided into 29 serotypes, based on the antigenic specificity of its capsular polysaccharide, which vary in pathogenicity.

_S. suis_ is an important pathogen of pigs, causing mainly septicemia with sudden death, meningitis, arthritis, and endocarditis, mostly in post-weaned piglets. _S. suis_ has also been isolated from asymptomatic pigs, usually from the throat, but also from the reproductive and GI tracts (<https://www.merckvetmanual.com/generalized-conditions/streptococcal-infections-in-pigs/streptococcus-suis-infection-in-pigs?query=streptococcus%20suis#v3275263>).

In humans, it causes a potentially fatal zoonotic infection, most commonly meningitis, but also sepsis or endocarditis; toxic shock has been reported if the pathogen produces the appropriate toxins.

_S. suis_ infection occurs mainly in pig breeders, abattoir workers, meat processors, cooks, and those who eat raw pork products. Consumption of raw pork is a common tradition in South East Asia, where infection with _S. suis_ associated with these products has been frequently reported (see prior ProMED posts listed below). Eating cooked meat or organs from infected pigs poses no risk and person-to-person spread does not seem to occur (<http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/50/2/201>).

For the patients in the news reports above, the source for infection was frequently blood pudding made from raw pig blood (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiết_canh>).

There is no human vaccine available for _S. suis_. Prevention of the disease in humans involves wearing gloves when handling raw pork and washing hands and cleaning utensils, equipment, and kitchen surfaces that have been in contact with raw pork (<https://www.chp.gov.hk/en/healthtopics/content/24/3648.html>) and all pork products should be cooked thoroughly before eating.

The viral infection, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) in pigs is known to have an immunosuppressive effect, which is thought to increase pigs' susceptibility to infection with _S. suis_. - Mod.ML

Since its introduction in Brazil in 2001, Asian soybean rust has been the most serious disease of soybean crops. The national Antirust Consortium said that recent cases of Asian soybean rust for the 2022/23 harvest exceeded 119 in 9 Brazilian states. Compared to the previous harvest period, between November 2022 and January 2023, this was an increase of more than 220% in just one cropping season.

Management strategies are centered on practices such as the ""sanitary void"" [host free period between crops] in the field for at least 90 days to reduce inoculum. Use of cultivars with early maturation sown at the beginning of their recommended period, as well as resistant cultivars and use of fungicides, can also help control the disease.

Currently, the fungus has mutations that confer resistance to the 3 main groups of site-specific fungicides [e.g. ProMED post 20171226.5523371]. New mutations can emerge over time counteracting some of the control strategies, such as losing sensitivity to additional fungicides or breaking down genetic resistance of soybean cultivars.

[Leaf rust (also called soybean rust, and Asian rust) caused by the fungus _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ can result in yield losses of soybean crops of up to 90 percent. It is widespread in Asia and Africa and spreading in the Americas, but data are lacking on its establishment in Europe. Besides soybean, over 30 other species in the family of Fabaceae can also be affected and may serve as pathogen reservoirs.

Spores are spread locally by splashing rain, or by wind over long distances. Several epidemic cycles may occur in one cropping season. In Brazil, volunteer soybeans as pathogen reservoirs have been identified as a threat to new crops (ProMED-mail post 20120911.1287887). Fungicides may be used in disease management, but timing of applications is considered important. Rotating or mixing chemical classes of fungicides is vital to extend the useful life of any of the compounds. Partially resistant soybean lines are available. However, as mentioned above, new fungal strains with increased virulence and fungicide resistances are emerging in soybean producing countries, including Brazil (ProMED posts 20171226.5523371, 20090501.1644).

While the related species _P. meibomiae_ is also found in South America and the Caribbean causing similar symptoms, it is not referred to as 'Asian' rust. This species is less virulent and considered of lesser economic significance.

.................................................dha/sb/dha/mj/lxl","Since its introduction in Brazil in 2001, Asian soybean rust has been the most serious disease of soybean crops. The national Antirust Consortium said that recent cases of Asian soybean rust for the 2022/23 harvest exceeded 119 in 9 Brazilian states. Compared to the previous harvest period, between November 2022 and January 2023, this was an increase of more than 220% in just one cropping season.Management strategies are centered on practices such as the ""sanitary void"" [host free period between crops] in the field for at least 90 days to reduce inoculum. Use of cultivars with early maturation sown at the beginning of their recommended period, as well as resistant cultivars and use of fungicides, can also help control the disease.Currently, the fungus has mutations that confer resistance to the 3 main groups of site-specific fungicides [e.g. ProMED post 20171226.5523371]. New mutations can emerge over time counteracting some of the control strategies, such as losing sensitivity to additional fungicides or breaking down genetic resistance of soybean cultivars.[Byline: Leonardo Gottems]--Communicated by:ProMED[Leaf rust (also called soybean rust, and Asian rust) caused by the fungus _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ can result in yield losses of soybean crops of up to 90 percent. It is widespread in Asia and Africa and spreading in the Americas, but data are lacking on its establishment in Europe. Besides soybean, over 30 other species in the family of Fabaceae can also be affected and may serve as pathogen reservoirs.Spores are spread locally by splashing rain, or by wind over long distances. Several epidemic cycles may occur in one cropping season. In Brazil, volunteer soybeans as pathogen reservoirs have been identified as a threat to new crops (ProMED-mail post 20120911.1287887). Fungicides may be used in disease management, but timing of applications is considered important. Rotating or mixing chemical classes of fungicides is vital to extend the useful life of any of the compounds. Partially resistant soybean lines are available. However, as mentioned above, new fungal strains with increased virulence and fungicide resistances are emerging in soybean producing countries, including Brazil (ProMED posts 20171226.5523371, 20090501.1644).While the related species _P. meibomiae_ is also found in South America and the Caribbean causing similar symptoms, it is not referred to as 'Asian' rust. This species is less virulent and considered of lesser economic significance.MapsBrazil:<https://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/samerica/lgcolor/brnewzzl.gif>,<https://geology.com/world/brazil-states-map.gif>, and <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8708936,6> (states)South America, overview:<https://ontheworldmap.com/south-america/political-map-of-south-america.jpg>PicturesLeaf rust on soybean:<http://www.ent.iastate.edu/images/plantpath/soybean/asianrust/asian_soyrust_lesions.jpg>,<http://www.state.nj.us/agriculture/plant/soybeanrust.jpg>, and<https://brunswick.ces.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/soybeanrustuuky.jpg>Close-up of rust pustules:<http://www.mississippi-crops.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/DSC00127.jpg>Fungicide treated vs. untreated crops:<http://eidupont.scene7.com/is/image/eidupont/cp_A-327_soybean_rust_callout_2>Electron microscopy of leaf rust pustules:<https://pesticideguy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/30-soybean-rust.png>LinksInformation on soybean leaf rust:<https://doi.org/10.1079/cabicompendium.40019><https://cropwatch.unl.edu/plantdisease/soybean/soybean-rust>,<https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1364-3703.2009.00589.x>,<https://doi.org/10.1590/0100-5405/220951>,<https://doi.org/10.1094/9780890546642.05> and<https://www.pioneer.com/home/site/us/agronomy/crop-management/soybean-insect-disease/soybean-rust/>Disease history and pathogen evolution:<https://doi.org/10.1590/S1415-47572008005000026>_P. pachyrhizi_ taxonomy & synonyms:<https://www.indexfungorum.org/Names/NamesRecord.asp?RecordID=121037> and<https://www.speciesfungorum.org/GSD/GSDspecies.asp?RecordID=121037>_P. meibomiae_ taxonomy & synonyms:<https://www.indexfungorum.org/Names/NamesRecord.asp?RecordID=102469> and<https://www.speciesfungorum.org/GSD/GSDspecies.asp?RecordID=102469>Fungicide groups & modes of action:<https://www.frac.info/fungicide-resistance-management/by-frac-mode-of-action-group>- Mod.DHA]",AgroPages,,

An outbreak of brucellosis, an infectious animal disease that is dangerous for humans, for which there is no vaccine, has been recorded at a dog and cat detention center in Yakutsk.

Human infection occurs through direct contact with the secretions of sick animals. 533 samples taken at the shelter were positive for brucellosis.

Viktor Semenov, deputy head of the Veterinary Department of the Republic of Yakutia [Republic of Sakha], said that brucellosis in the shelter is the main problem in Yakutsk today. The results of laboratory tests are expected from St. Petersburg and Stavropol.

""After the examinations that were carried out in the Yakut Republican Veterinary Testing Laboratory, Moscow and Amur laboratories, we are waiting for bacterial studies from St. Petersburg and Stavropol. After that, further measures will be taken to solve this problem,"" Viktor Semenov said.

Animals that are kept in shelters are prohibited from being killed; they can only be euthanized ""in case of a disease, identified by a veterinarian, that is incompatible with the life of the animal."" Also, local animal rights activists believe that the tests give a false result, and that [the authorities] just want to get rid of the animals.

At the Yakut detention centre, there are now 919 animals, caught within the all-Russian OSVV program (""catch, sterilize, vaccinate, return""). The dog must be examined, quarantined if necessary, vaccinated, sterilized, and after 30 days, if the dog is healthy and does not present aggression, returned to the site where it was picked up.

Public activists claim that brucellosis was detected in October [2022] in one of the city veterinary clinics in domestic dogs of the Cane Corso breed [<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cane_Corso>]. The study was carried out by ELISA kit manufactured by the Kursk biofactory, which, according to animal rights activists, ""often present false positive results.""

The infection, according to animal rights activists, is curable, but according to the order of the Ministry of Agriculture, the animals must be euthanized. [A dog owner] from Nyurba, whose dog they wanted to euthanize because of alleged brucellosis, recorded a video message to the head of Yakutia, Aisen Nikolaev.

""We know that there is such a video message. In Nyurba there was, according to the results of the analysis of the Moscow [Vladimir] laboratory, a positive test for brucellosis in a puppy. Now, after all these appeals, we are waiting for bacterial studies, and after these studies, we will take all measures. This dog [from Nyurba] has not been euthanized and is with the owners at the moment,"" said Viktor Semenov, deputy head of the Department of Veterinary Medicine of the Republic of Yakutia.

[It may be assumed that _Brucella canis_ is the causative agent of the canine brucellosis cases suspected in dogs in Yakutsk (the world's coldest major city). It should be clearly differentiated from other _Brucella_ species, in particular _B. abortus_, _B. melitensis_, and _B. suis_, important zoonotic pathogens. Occasionally, these _Brucella_ species may be associated with disease in dogs. Final results from Russia's reference laboratories are expected with interest, allowing adequate further measures undertaken to protect human and animal health.

_B. canis_ ""is an important cause of reproductive failure in dogs, especially in kennels. Infections can result in abortions and stillbirths in bitches, and epididymitis, prostatitis, orchitis, and sperm abnormalities in males. Although spayed or neutered dogs do not have reproductive signs, they occasionally develop other conditions such as ocular disease and discospondylitis. _B. canis_ may persist in an animal even after antibiotic treatment. In kennels, infected dogs are often euthanized to prevent them from infecting other dogs or people. Canine brucellosis is sometimes difficult to diagnose with the currently available tests.

""The importance of _B. canis_ as a cause of human illness is still unclear. Few clinical cases have been reported in people, and most have been mild. However, human infections with this organism may be underdiagnosed, as the symptoms are nonspecific, diagnostic suspicion among physicians is low, and obtaining a definitive diagnosis may be difficult.""

""Dogs are thought to be the only significant hosts for _B. canis_ among domesticated animals.""

""Antibodies to _B. canis_ have also been reported occasionally in wild canids.""

""_B. canis_ appears to be widely distributed and has been reported in North, Central, and South America and parts of Asia, Africa, and Europe.""

ECDC Communicable Disease Threats Report Week 10, 5-11 Mar 2023
Iatrogenic botulism, exposure in Turkey
---------------------------------------------------------------
Overview
--------
As of [Fri 10 Mar 2023], Germany reports 12 cases of clinical botulism, apparently iatrogenic, due to intragastric injection of botulism neurotoxin (BoNT). The cases are middle-aged adults, originating from different regions of Germany, who underwent treatments with 1000-1500 units of BoNT in Turkey between [22 and 25 Feb 2023]. The clinical presentation of the cases ranged from mild to severe; several cases have been hospitalized among whom a number are reported to have been admitted to Intensive Care Units (ICU). Among 8 cases with known information, all received treatment at the same clinic in Istanbul, Turkey. There is no indication of treatment being organized by a commercial medical travel company at this time. Information received from patient interviews indicated a WhatsApp group was used to contact the hospital. A total of 3 cases who recalled the name of the BoNT product used on them, reported having been treated with one and the same product.

Austria reports 1 case (female; 25-44 years) of apparently iatrogenic botulism after intragastric injection of BoNTs administered in Turkey on [22 Feb 2023]. The case reported receiving treatment, which was self-arranged, at the same clinic as the cases in Germany and Switzerland. The patient was hospitalized with botulism symptoms (ptosis, dysphagia, dyspnea, neck weakness, generalised muscle weakness).

Switzerland (information reported to ECDC by France on behalf of Switzerland) reports 1 suspected case of botulism (female, 45-64 years), probably associated with intragastric injection of BoNT, also administered in Turkey on [22 Feb 2023]. The case reported receiving treatment at the same clinic as the cases in Germany and Austria.

Background information
----------------------
In 2019, France reported a suspected case of botulism (female; 25-44 years) following an intragastric injection of BoNT in Egypt (in order to lose weight), with hospitalization in France.

A WHO medical product alert from August [2022], reported 5 falsified batches of a BoNT product detected in 5 countries - Jordan [May 2022], Turkey [May 2022], Kuwait [June 2022], United Kingdom [June 2022], and Poland [July 2022]. It is not known, however, if these batches have been used for treatment in the cases reported so far. Outbreaks of iatrogenic botulism, sometimes linked to counterfeit or unlicensed BoNT, have also been reported in the past following different clinical procedures, for example in Egypt and Turkey.

Botulism is a serious neuroparalytic illness caused by BoNTs mainly produced by the bacterium, _Clostridium botulinum_. The disease naturally occurs in 4 different forms: a) food-borne botulism, b) intestinal botulism, c) infant botulism, and d) wound botulism. There are 2 other forms of botulism that do not occur naturally: a) inhalation botulism and b) iatrogenic botulism, which is the most recent human-made form of botulism. Intoxication may occur as an adverse event following the administration of BoNTs for therapeutic or cosmetic reasons.

While it is considered rare, individuals receiving BoNT injections for cosmetic purposes (for example: for facial wrinkle lines) or therapeutic treatments (for example: for management of muscle spasticity), may develop iatrogenic botulism if they are injected with an excessive dose of the BoNTs.

Symptoms of iatrogenic botulism are characterized by weakness and difficulty swallowing. Toxicities following cosmetic treatment include ophthalmological and oropharyngeal symptoms (blurred vision, drooping eyelid, difficulty swallowing, and dry mouth) while toxicities following therapeutic treatments are linked with difficulty breathing and weakness. The symptoms of botulism can be very severe requiring intensive-care treatment as well as the administration of an anti-toxin. Even when such treatments are available, complete recovery usually takes weeks to months. Limited information is available quantifying mortality in iatrogenic botulism cases. For foodborne botulism, 5-10% of cases are fatal.

Further information about botulism can be found on the websites of ECDC, US CDC, and WHO. 

ECDC assessment
---------------
This is a multi-country outbreak of at least 14 cases of iatrogenic botulism in Germany (12 cases), Austria (1 case), and Switzerland (1 case) with gastric injections of BoNT administered in Istanbul, Turkey on dates between [22 and 25 Feb 2023]. The cases are middle-aged adults. Among cases with known information in Germany (8 cases), Austria (1 case), and Switzerland (1 case), all are reported to have received treatment at the same clinic. Considering the possible variation in the clinical presentation of botulism illness it is possible that some cases are yet to be identified. New cases may occur, particularly among those traveling to Turkey for medical treatments involving intragastric injection of BoNTs.

Individuals who have traveled to Istanbul, Turkey for intragastric BoNT treatment and experience symptoms consistent with botulism illness (weakness, difficulty breathing, and/or swallowing), are advised to seek medical attention as soon as possible. Patients may inform their healthcare provider of the present ongoing multi-country outbreak.

Actions
-------
ECDC is monitoring the event in EpiPulse and via Epidemic Intelligence activities and is sharing information through the CDTR report. A teleconference call is scheduled with affected and involved countries, DG SANTE, and WHO- Europe on [Fri 10 Mar 2023]. ECDC encourages countries to report any information relevant to this outbreak in the EpiPulse event 2023-FWD-00013.

[Now there are more cases reported from Germany and single cases from Austria and Switzerland. In all cases where the information is available, the therapy was given at the same clinic in Istanbul, Turkey.

Injecting the gastric muscles with botulinum toxin A is sometimes used as a relatively minimally invasive weight loss procedure. The injections are done using endoscopy with a flexible tube equipped with a syringe, inserted into the stomach through the mouth.

The medication immobilizes the muscles of the stomach wall for about 3 months, preventing the injected muscles from contracting. This results in the food in the stomach staying longer, slowing digestion and the patient feels fuller faster and for a longer time.

Initially, studies in mice did show desired weight loss but there remains debate on whether the therapy is effective in achieving the weight loss goal. As an example, the following non-controlled study, actually from Istanbul, Turkey, in 13 patients did not show positive results.

Abstract
---------
""Background/Aims: The aim of this study is to share the results of gastric botulinum toxin (BTX) application in individuals who are overweight or type 1 obese without comorbidity.

""Materials and Methods: In this study, 13 patients were included who were enrolled for gastric BTX application for the first time. A total of 300 U of BTX-A (Allergan Botox ®1 vial 100 U) was diluted with 8 mL of 0.9% NaCl saline, and antrum (100 U to 8 spots), corpus (100 U to 8 spots), and fundus (100 U to 8 spots) regions were injected intramuscularly. Patients were given a 1200-calorie low-carb diet and this was followed for 6 months.

""Results: Gastric BTX application was applied to 13 patients with a mean age of 40.9 ± 5.2 (85% female), a mean body mass index (BMI) of 28.41 ± 1.4 kg/m2 (26-31.6) and a mean excess weight of 10.1 ± 3.6 kg. As a result of the 6-month follow-up, only 4 patients (30.8%) were able to lose more than 50% of their excess weight (6-15 kg). A total of 6 patients (46.2%) could not lose any weight. There was an average decrease of 3.3 kg in the weight of patients before and after BTX application (P = .03). A mean decrease of BMI was detected, 1.17 kg/m2 (P = .032).

""Conclusion: It was concluded that the application of gastric BTX for weight loss does not provide effective results.""

The following is extracted from the above paper (the citations can be found in the original URL):
""In the literature, there are 3 experimental studies that investigated the effect of BTX [botox] application in the stomach on weight loss and stomach functions. The first one is the study by Gui et al. where they compared the injection of BTX and saline into the gastric antrum in mice. After 10 weeks of follow-up, they detected more weight loss and less food consumption in the BTX group (8). In a similar study conducted in our country, it was found that weight loss was observed for a temporary period and gastric emptying was accelerated in the scintigraphic study (9). A similar study from Korea has recently been published, and a 6-week follow-up revealed significant weight loss in mice treated with BTX compared to the saline group.

""BTX application to stomach in an obese patient was performed for the first time by Rolnikk et al. and it was published as a case study. In this study, 100 U BTX were applied to the pre-pyloric antral wall in a patient with a BMI of 31.4 kg/m2 and a decrease of 8.9% was observed in the total BMI (10). Later, the first clinical study was done by Garcia-Compean et al. In their study, Garcia-Compean et al. applied 100 U BTX to 8 spots in the antrum in 12 obese individuals, and they did not detect any significant difference in terms of weight loss after 8 weeks of follow-up (11). Foschi et al. administered saline to one group of patients and 200 U of BTX were applied to the antrum in another group, and both groups were supported with a 1200-calorie diet. During the follow-up, the BTX group lost an average of 11.2 kg and the saline group lost 5.7 kg (12) of excess weight. In a study by Liu et al., 300 and 100 U BTX were compared and it was detected that 300 U provided more weight loss (13) In another study by Topazian et al. including 60 patients, patients were divided into 4 groups and saline, 100, 300 and 500 U BTX injections were administered using guided ultrasound. After 16 weeks of follow-up, there was no difference in weight loss in the groups (14).

""Two meta-analyses have been published on gastric BTX application. The first, published by Bang et al. in 2015, evaluates 7 studies and BTX application was found to be more effective than placebo (15). The 2nd meta-analysis was published in 2017 and it was concluded that the application of BTX to the stomach has no effect on weight loss (16).

""In our study, at the end of the 6-month follow-up after 300 U of BTX application, when the patients were compared according to their weight status, there was an average decrease of 3.3 kg (P = .03). As many as 6 patients could not lose any weight. However, 4 patients were able to lose more than 50% of their excess weight (6-15 kg). The remaining 3 patients were able to lose 25% of their excess weight. When this comparison was made in terms of BMI, after 6 months, a decrease of 1.17 kg/m2 was detected in patients (P = .032).

""Gastric BTX application has recently become one of the frequently used weight loss methods in our country. The reason might be that it is non-invasive and perceived as a completely risk-free weight-loss therapy. In our study, no complications developed in the patients administered BTX. In fact, there were no serious side effects reported in clinical studies either. Only in one case report, total gastric necrosis after BTX application was reported which necessitated total gastrectomy (17). In the report published in 2008 due to various indications for BTX application, the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reported 16 deaths due to respiratory arrest aspiration pneumonia (17,18) From this perspective, gastric BTX should not be seen as a completely risk-free application.

""In our study, only overweight and type 1 obese individuals without comorbidity were included. Morbidly obese individuals were not included. Participants received a single session of BTX application. With repeated BTX applications, no evidence has been obtained as to whether a more effective weight loss can be achieved in this study.""

It remains to be seen how effective this modality is in the short and long-term management of obesity. This report appears to document one of the risk factors of therapeutic botulinum toxin injection, that is, the development of clinical botulism. With this cluster of cases, one would suspect problems with dosing and/or administration techniques. - Mod.LL

Five cases of leptospirosis or rat urine [?] were found in Sampang District, East Java. Based on data from the Sampang Regency Health and Family Planning Office, the 5 cases of leptospirosis were registered from January [2023] to early March 2023.

Head of the Community Health and Family Planning Office of Sampang, Agus Mulyadi, said that 5 people were infected with leptospirosis when the flood affected Sampang Regency. When the seasonal disaster comes, rats appear a lot. ""Basically, leptospirosis easily infects residents during floods or stagnant water. _Leptospira_ bacteria can enter the body through the skin, especially of those with open wounds,"" said Agus in his statement on Friday [10 Mar 2023].

The Agricultural and Livestock Service, SAG, confirmed the detection of the 1st case of avian influenza in the private sector, corresponding to an industrial poultry farm located in O'Higgins region. After the finding, the SAG activated the existing protocol that involves the slaughter of affected birds and the isolation of the area, sanitary measures that aim to prevent the spread of the disease to other poultry farms.

The Minister of Agriculture, Esteban Valenzuela, specified that it is ""a confirmed case in a commercial premises in the western sector of the Rancagua commune. The SAG has proceeded to control the area and in addition, immediately and in compliance with the highest standards, the World Organization for Animal Health (OMSA) has been informed and, therefore, the export of poultry meat has been ceased,"" said the authority.

The measure, taken by the SAG, translates into the self-suspension of the certification of exports of national poultry products, a decision reported to the WOAH and all its trading partners.

Regarding this, Carlos Orellana, head of SAG's Livestock Protection Division, explained that the measure taken by the Service is based on the fact that ""we are now seeing the involvement of a commercial farm, we are talking about 40 000 breeding birds. This farm is located in Region VI [O'Higgins Region], and as a precaution, we have suspended our export certification,"" he said.

The SAG reaffirms the urgent call to poultry owners to take extreme biosecurity measures in their facilities, mainly locking up their birds to avoid contact with wild birds or others that could be affected, to avoid the contagion with highly pathogenic avian influenza and in case of suspected symptoms to contact the SAG immediately.

When the folks at SeaWorld's animal rescue team saw a lethargic juvenile sea lion at La Jolla Cove [San Diego County, California], they knew something was wrong. The problem turned out to be 2 things, both of them rather unexpected.

First, the male sea lion rescued on 12 Jan 2023 tested positive for a rare and contagious bacterium that is harmful -- and potentially deadly -- to both animals and humans. It was the 1st time the bacteria have been found in local waters in 8 years, SeaWorld San Diego veterinarian Dr Kelsey Herrick said Friday [9 Mar 2023].

Then there was the surprising matter of the rocks in the animal's stomach. Sea lions eat them from time to time. But this 1.5-old pinniped had gulped down about 100. ""That was very striking,"" Herrick said. ""We were like, 'Wow, that is a lot of rocks.'"" And that find earned the sea lion an affectionate nickname: Rocky.

Herrick said there is no evidence of a local outbreak of leptospirosis, a potentially lethal bacterial disease. It's also what she called a ""zoonotic"" pathogen, in that it can transfer from animals to humans and back.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, bacteria that cause leptospirosis spread through the urine of infected animals, and can survive for weeks or months in water or soil.

After SeaWorld San Diego found Rocky, the organization rescued a 2nd sea lion -- this one at Torrey Pines [San Diego County, California] -- that tested positive, the veterinarian said. But it had other medical issues and was euthanized.

Herrick said the medical team suspected Rocky had leptospirosis early on -- the sea lion was drinking water excessively, and the disease affects the kidneys -- so the team started antibiotic treatment and kept the animal in quarantine. The team also had to give Rocky fluids at 3 to 4 times the usual dose.

The sea lion started eating but still ""looked like he didn't feel good,"" the veterinarian said. The medical team X-rayed the animal and found the rocks, dozens of them.

Herrick leans toward the possibility that after Rocky caught the bacteria, the animal slurped up the rocks while drinking sea water excessively -- a behavior that itself is odd. Sea lions don't drink water. They get their water from eating fish.

The medical team tried to get Rocky to vomit some of the stones out, Herrick said, but ""his stomach was too heavy."" So the team performed 5 procedures over 5 weeks, during which the doctors removed several rocks from Rocky's stomach each time.

""He also removed some rocks on his own -- in 2 different ways,"" Rescue Team member Jeni Smith said -- with a laugh -- in a video interview provided by SeaWorld. ""We removed over a 1.5 lb [about 680 gm] of rocks from that California sea lion -- which is crazy.""

Getting rid of the rocks cleared room in Rocky's belly for food. When the team rescued the sea lion in January [2023], he weighed nearly 63 pounds. By the time he was released back into the ocean 3 Mar 2023], he was pushing 95 pounds [about 29 kg].

Rocky had company on his return home. SeaWorld San Diego also released an elephant seal found in Imperial Beach in January [2023]. The seal, a female, was dehydrated and suffering from more than 10 cookie-cutter shark bites. ""Poor thing had bites everywhere, Smith said. ""Her wounds have healed,"" Smith said. ""She looks amazing and she gets a 2nd chance.""

It was the only elephant seal among the 17 wild animals SeaWorld San Diego rescued and brought to its facility this year [2023]. Rocky was one of 10 rescued sea lions. The other rescues this year include 1 harbor seal, 2 sea turtles, and 3 Guadalupe fur seals.

The goal is to heal them and return them to the ocean.

Parents living in St Thomas, Elgin, and Oxford counties in Ottawa were recently advised to be alert to respiratory symptoms, which are particularly dangerous in young children. Symptoms of the vaccine-preventable disease pertussis start with a runny nose or nasal congestion, sneezing, mild cough, and mild fever.

Southwestern Public Health, which is located between Detroit and Toronto, announced on 8  Mar 2023, parents and guardians should keep themselves and their children up to date with the pertussis vaccine after a recent dramatic rise in cases in the region.

""Our region has seen 82 confirmed cases of pertussis between January 2022 and 28 Feb 2023. This represents about 40% of the provincial total from that time period."" ""Combine this with the number of children who are unvaccinated or under-vaccinated, and I am concerned in particular for the youngest members of our community,"" says Dr Ninh Tran, Medical Officer of Health for Southwestern Public Health, in a related press release [<https://www.swpublichealth.ca/en/news/swph-warns-community-of-rising-cases-of-pertussis.aspx>].

Pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, is a vaccine-preventable disease. This vaccine is routinely administered to children along with protection from polio, tetanus, and diphtheria (DTaP). In the US, DTaP vaccines such as Boostrix are offered at clinics and pharmacies. Pertussis is very contagious and spreads via droplets from the noses and mouths of those who are infected. The cough, which can last anywhere from 2 to 8 weeks, gets progressively worse and may lead to vomiting or trouble breathing and coughing up mucous. It can often be recognized by the loud ""whooping"" sound that occurs when the child is inhaling after a coughing spell. Untreated pertussis in infants can lead to hospitalization, brain damage, and death.

Furthermore, new research indicates an expecting mother can take action to protect her future child. According to an Original Investigation published by JAMA Pediatrics in February 2023 [<https://www.precisionvaccinations.com/maternal-vaccination-reduces-whopping-cough>], maternal Tdap vaccination reduces pertussis burden in infants (2 months). ""I have 2 asks of our local parents. The first is that you make yourself familiar with the symptoms of pertussis and seek medical care if your child has these symptoms. It can be treated with antibiotics, and after 5 days on the treatment, the person can no longer spread the disease to others. Second, please contact your family healthcare provider or Southwestern Public Health to get your child's routine vaccinations up to date. The vaccine is free, and we have openings in our clinics throughout the month of March 2023,"" adds Tran.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) reported the country's 1st case of highly pathogenic avian influenza in nearly a month. However, the most recent case did not involve a commercial poultry operation.

CFIA reported HPAI was confirmed in a backyard poultry flock in Yarmouth County, Nova Scotia. The number of birds affected was not released.

Prior to this, the last cases of HPAI were confirmed on 8 Feb [2023] in which 3 commercial poultry flocks in Quebec were affected. Two of those cases were in the Beauharnois-Salaberry Regional County Municipality, and the other was in the Le Haut-Saint-Laurent Regional County Municipality. [One] day prior [7 Feb 2023] was Nova Scotia's most recent case, also involving a non-commercial operation.

The last case of HPAI in a commercial poultry operation in Nova Scotia was on 11 Feb 2022. While Nova Scotia was the 1st province to have a commercial poultry operation affected by HPAI during the 2022-23 outbreak, it has only had 2 cases in commercial poultry.

An area in Yarmouth County is the spot of the latest outbreak, declared over the weekend at a non-commercial property.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency tells CBC it came from a small flock of mixed poultry in Port Maitland. All of the birds have been killed.

Meanwhile, the Liberals are calling for the government to fund a testing lab for the province.

Agriculture Shadow Minister Keith Irving says samples have to be sent away to other provinces, resulting in longer wait times for farmers.

<https://globalnews.ca/news/9533916/avian-flu-outbreak-sask-concerns/>


The worldwide avian influenza outbreak is causing concerns amongst researchers and poultry farmers across Saskatchewan. While the risks to human health are minimal as of yet, governments and commercial organizations are asking everyone to be vigilant.

Worldwide, millions of birds have been infected with the H5N1 virus. According to the Chicken Farmers of Canada, this outbreak is the largest ever recorded.

The ongoing avian influenza reporting by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency shows about half a million birds in Saskatchewan have been infected as of 1 Mar 2023. The total reported cases for Canada is at 7.2 million. British Columbia and Alberta have been hit the hardest, with both provinces having over a million birds infected.

Chicken Farmers of Canada says an outbreak can threaten the domestic food chain. If poultry farms become infected, there could potentially be huge economic damage.

""Our chicken farmers prepare for avian influenza every year by following stringent, science-based, on-farm biosecurity protocols. With the recent outbreak of the H5N1 variant, farmers are taking extra measures and working with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency in order to limit spread.""

The organization stresses avian influenza does not cause any threat to food safety.

""There is no evidence to suggest the avian influenza virus can be transmitted to humans through the consumption of food, notably poultry and eggs. We have consumers' trust for good reason, and we continue to work hard to grow the high-quality, safe chicken products Canadians expect.""

Dr. Alyson Kelvin, research scientist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization (VIDO) says most avian flus are mild and often don't even cause sickness, but the current strain of the virus is particularly aggressive in the bird population, both in signs and spread. However, so far, the virus has only posed a very minor threat to human health.

""It is uncommon for a virus to cross the species barrier, and we have seen the current strain has a lot of trouble crossing that barrier. However, viruses are always unpredictable, so we are monitoring for changes and virus behavior at the moment. There have been perhaps billions of birds affected worldwide, but there have only been a small handful of cases of H5N1 in people, so we see that as a positive sign the virus seems to have trouble infecting humans.""

The virus has been detected in other animal species, though.

""In addition to mortality in wild birds, mainly raptors, waterfowl, shorebirds, and corvids, the virus has also been detected in several species of mammals, including foxes, skunks, and black bear,"" said the Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment.

The Saskatchewan ministries of agriculture and environment are closely watching the situation. The Ministry of Agriculture is coordinating with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and the poultry industry to prepare for any outbreaks during the spring wild bird migration.

In a statement to Global News, the Ministry of Agriculture said they are proactively reaching out to producers to reinforce the importance of biosecurity measures and the need to monitor flocks for illnesses.

""Poultry owners are reminded to take an active role in protecting their flocks by maintaining high levels of biosecurity, which includes preventing contact between poultry and wild birds -- both directly and indirectly through contaminated environments, feed, and water -- limiting visitors to barns, using barn-specific clothing and footwear, and regularly monitoring birds for signs of illness.""

The Saskatchewan Ministry of Health also warns the public against handling dead or sick birds.

""While the risk of human infection remains low, the public is advised to avoid handling sick or dead birds. They should also report animals showing neurological signs or instances of multiple dead animals to the ministry Inquiry Centre, or through the Canadian Wildlife Health Co-operative Wildlife Health Tracker app.

""Hunters should take routine hygiene precautions when handling wild game and cook game meat thoroughly before eating it.""

<https://www.wattagnet.com/articles/46885-three-new-avian-flu-cases-confirmed-in-pennsylvania>


Three cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) were confirmed in commercial poultry flocks in Pennsylvania on 4 Mar [2023].

According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), all 3 of those cases were confirmed in Lancaster County. Two of those cases involved commercial meat turkey flocks, while the other involved a flock of commercial duck breeders.

One of the turkey flocks involved approximately 25 000 birds, while the other involved approximately 20 000 birds. The duck breeder flock involved about 6500 birds.

Pennsylvania had 2 previous cases of HPAI in commercial poultry flocks in 2023. One involved a flock of 97 700 commercial broilers and the other a flock of 32 800 commercial meat ducks. Both of those cases were also in Lancaster County.

In 2022, Pennsylvania lost 25 commercial poultry flocks to HPAI, more than all other states except for Minnesota and South Dakota. In terms of bird losses, approximately 4.35 [million] head of commercial poultry died as a result of the HPAI outbreak. Only Iowa, Nebraska, and Colorado lost more birds during 2022.

Eight of those flocks affected by HPAI in 2022 were in Lancaster County, involving commercial table egg layers, commercial meat ducks, commercial broilers, and commercial broiler breeder pullets. Two of those layer flocks involved more than 1 million chickens.

In addition to Pennsylvania, other states to have confirmed cases of HPAI in commercial operations in 2023 include Illinois, Mississippi, California, Iowa, Virginia, Tennessee, and Kansas.

Since the avian influenza outbreak that killed millions of chickens began last year [2022], there have been almost 800 reported cases of the disease infecting wild birds across the Mountain West, according to the US Department of Agriculture.

The department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has a wild bird program to detect the spread of the virus. Common birds on the list include raptors like eagles and owls as well as waterfowl.

[A USDA map of positive samples of avian flu in wild birds, as of 7 Mar 2023 can be seen at <https://bit.ly/3YSFQcU>. - Mod.TG]

As of 7 Mar [2023], Colorado has had 206 samples from wild birds that have tested positive for the H5N1 virus, the most in the region. Utah has had 139; Wyoming, 131; and Montana, 119.

Yael Braun heads the Teton Wildlife Rehabilitation Center. When it comes to birds, she says there are permits to rehab songbirds and waterfowl.

""Last year we saw a couple of cases we suspect [had avian flu],"" she said. ""We don't have the resources to check it and draw blood and send it to labs and stuff like that.""

She's based in Idaho, where 78 wild bird samples have tested positive so far.

Braun says she's taking extra precautions when treating birds, including isolating them and wearing protective gear.

Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico have had 59, 29, and 7 cases, respectively.

[Clearly, and perhaps quite sadly, avian influenza is with us, thus requiring continued diligence regarding safeguarding our birds. Spring migration is just beginning, and biosecurity is paramount for the birds. So take a look at your biosecurity for your birds and tighten it up. It may mean deliveries are actually offsite and delivered only by your known associates. It may mean clean coveralls and boots for each building and each person entering. Any protective equipment (masks, coveralls, boots, etc.) should mean a clean set for each barn, hutch, or pen, daily. It should mean clean hairnet, face mask, and gloves for each individual and each barn.

Be alert for early signs of the disease. Do not let wild birds and your birds comingle in any way, or drink from the same water source. - Mod.TG

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
---------
Background
We report 2-year persistence of immune response to Takeda's prophylactic purified formalin-inactivated whole Zika virus vaccine candidate (TAK-426) compared with that observed after natural infection.

Methods
A randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-selection, phase 1 trial was conducted in 18-49-year-old adults at 9 centers (7 in the United States, 2 in Puerto Rico) from 13 Nov 2017 to 24 Nov 2020. Primary objectives were safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 3 increasing doses of TAK-426 administered as 2 doses 28 days apart to flavivirus (FV)-naive and FV-primed adults. Here, we report on safety and persistence of immunity up to 2 years after primary vaccination with 10-μg TAK-426, the highest dose, and compare neutralizing antibody responses with those observed after natural infection.

Results
TAK-426 at 10-μg had an acceptable safety profile in FV-naive and FV-primed adults up to 24 months after dose 2. Seropositivity for neutralizing antibodies was 100% at 1 year, and 93.8% and 76.2% at 2 years in FV-naive and FV-primed groups, respectively. TAK-426 responses were comparable in magnitude and kinetics with those elicited by natural Zika virus infection.

Conclusions
These results support the further clinical development of TAK-426 for both FV-naive and FV-primed populations.

[The question with inactivated vaccines is the duration of immunity. This vaccine produced neutralizing antibodies up to 2 years with acceptable safety. It will be interesting to see how long protective immunity to Zika virus infections lasts when natural challenge in the field occurs. The promising results of this reported trial indicated that a more extensive phase 3 is justified. One hopes that that the cost of the vaccine when licensed is modest enough to be affordable in the countries where Zika virus circulates. - Mod.TY]

[3] Barbados and the Americas 2022

The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) updated its Arboviral situation summary today with data indicating that a coral island in the Lesser Antilles of the West Indies was confronted with an extensive Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak last year [2022].

Zika transmission can occur in most areas where the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_ is found. This means there is the potential for transmission throughout much of the Caribbean Islands, says the PAHO.

In 2022, the PAHO reported a total of 37 869 ZIKV cases in the Region of the Americas in 15 out of 52 countries and territories.

The most significant number of Zika cases in the Region was reported by Brazil, with 34 176.

But on a cumulative incidence per 100 000 population basis, Barbados, with about 280 000 residents, led the Region at 48.

Brazil's rate was just 16, based on a population of 214 million.

To alert international visitors of their potential ZIKV health risk when visiting Barbados, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued an Alert - Level 2, Practice Enhanced Precautions. However, the CDC withdrew this alert on 30 Jun 2021.

The CDC currently says, ""We do not have accurate information on the current level of risk.""

However, both Canada and the United Kingdom (UK) had enough information to publish ZIKV advice for people visiting Barbados last year [2022].

The UK represented about 50% of all international visitors in 2022.

Because Zika is a cause of severe congenital disabilities, such as microcephaly, the CDC, Canada, and the UK recommend pregnant women and couples trying to become pregnant within the next few months speak with their healthcare providers to carefully consider the risks and possible consequences of travel to areas with risk of Zika [virus infection].

If a woman is pregnant, she should not visit areas with ZIKV outbreaks, says the CDC. Furthermore, these countries have not approved a Zika-prevention vaccine as of 28 Jan 2023.

[It is difficult to assess risk where cases in tourist destinations in a given locations are scattered geographically and sporadic temporally. However, fetal abnormalities when Zika virus infections occur in pregnant women can be severe and suggest that caution for travel is prudent. Couples who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant should be fully informed about potential risk when making travel decisions. - Mod.TY]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Background
Children with congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) have severe damage to the peripheral and central nervous system (CNS), greatly increasing the risk of death. However, there is no information on the sequence of the underlying, intermediate, immediate, and contributing causes of deaths among these children. The aims of this study are to describe the sequence of events leading to death of children with CZS up to 36 months of age and their probability of dying from a given cause, 2015 to 2018.

Methods and findings
In a population-based study, we linked administrative data on live births, deaths, and cases of children with CZS from the SINASC (Live Birth Information System), the SIM (Mortality Information System), and the RESP (Public Health Event Records), respectively. Confirmed and probable cases of CZS were those that met the criteria established by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. The information on causes of death was collected from death certificates (DCs) using the World Health Organization (WHO) DC template. We estimated proportional mortality (PM%) among children with CZS and among children with non-Zika CNS congenital anomalies (CA) by 36 months of age and proportional mortality ratio by cause (PMRc). A total of 403 children with confirmed and probable CZS who died up to 36 months of age were included in the study; 81.9% were younger than 12 months of age. Multiple congenital malformations not classified elsewhere, and septicemia unspecified, with 18 (PM = 4.5%) and 17 (PM = 4.2%) deaths, respectively, were the most attested underlying causes of death. Unspecified septicemia (29 deaths and PM = 11.2%) and newborn respiratory failure (40 deaths and PM = 12.1%) were, respectively, the predominant intermediate and immediate causes of death. Fetuses and newborns affected by the mother's infectious and parasitic diseases, unspecified cerebral palsy, and unspecified severe protein-caloric malnutrition were the underlying causes with the greatest probability of death in children with CZS (PMRc from 10.0 to 17.0) when compared to the group born with non-Zika CNS anomalies. Among the intermediate and immediate causes of death, pneumonitis due to food or vomiting and unspecified seizures (PMRc = 9.5, each) and unspecified bronchopneumonia (PMRc = 5.0) were notable. As contributing causes, fetus and newborn affected by the mother's infectious and parasitic diseases (PMRc = 7.3), unspecified cerebral palsy, and newborn seizures (PMRc = 4.5, each) were more likely to lead to death in children with CZS than in the comparison group. The main limitations of this study were the use of a secondary database without additional clinical information and potential misclassification of cases and controls.

Conclusion
The sequence of causes and circumstances involved in the deaths of the children with CZS highlights the greater vulnerability of these children to infectious and respiratory conditions compared to children with abnormalities of the CNS not related to Zika.

Author summary
Why was this study done?
- Children with congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) have a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations due to sequelae of central and peripheral nervous system damage that can impair important vital functions and greatly increase the risk of death in affected children.
- Little is known about the circumstances involved in the death of children affected by this syndrome.
- Analysis of the sequences of causes attested on the death certificate (DC) can contribute to this understanding and thus support the implementation of health programs and specific postnatal protocols to meet the needs of these children.
- Brazil was the country with the highest number of live births with CZS.

What did the researchers do and find?
- We linked administrative data of all reporting live births, deaths, and notification of probable and confirmed CZS cases in Brazil in the period from 1 Jan 2015 to 31 Dec 2018.
- We analyzed the proportional mortality of the main underlying, intermediate, immediate, and contributing causes of death of 403 children with CZS up to 36 months age and compared with the same causes of death of 734 children with non-Zika-related CNS congenital anomalies (CA) who died by 36 months of age from the proportional mortality ratio.
- The leading underlying causes of death for children with CZS were multiple congenital malformations not classified elsewhere and unspecified septicemia.

What do these findings mean?
- The sequence of causes and circumstances involved in the deaths of the CZS children by 36 months age, in Brazil, highlighted the greater vulnerability of these children to infectious and respiratory conditions.
- It is necessary to develop evidence-based health protocols and raising awareness of conditions associated with high mortality in children affected by congenital Zika virus infection to guide health professionals responsible for caring for these children.

[The number of affected children in this study is not insignificant. These finding argue for establishment of protocols going forward in order to quantify the cause of death in these Zika-virus infected children and provide adequate and appropriate treatment for future cases. - Mod.TY]

[Although the numbers of cases of Zika virus infection are relatively low this year (2023), the virus has not disappeared. Continued surveillance to identify cases is necessary. The risk of outbreaks is still present as are new cases of CZS. - Mod.TY]

The main limitations of this study were the use of a secondary database without additional clinical information and potential misclassification of cases and controls.ConclusionThe sequence of causes and circumstances involved in the deaths of the children with CZS highlights the greater vulnerability of these children to infectious and respiratory conditions compared to children with abnormalities of the CNS not related to Zika.Author summaryWhy was this study done?- Children with congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) have a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations due to sequelae of central and peripheral nervous system damage that can impair important vital functions and greatly increase the risk of death in affected children.- Little is known about the circumstances involved in the death of children affected by this syndrome.- Analysis of the sequences of causes attested on the death certificate (DC) can contribute to this understanding and thus support the implementation of health programs and specific postnatal protocols to meet the needs of these children.- Brazil was the country with the highest number of live births with CZS.What did the researchers do and find?- We linked administrative data of all reporting live births, deaths, and notification of probable and confirmed CZS cases in Brazil in the period from 1 Jan 2015 to 31 Dec 2018.- We analyzed the proportional mortality of the main underlying, intermediate, immediate, and contributing causes of death of 403 children with CZS up to 36 months age and compared with the same causes of death of 734 children with non-Zika-related CNS congenital anomalies (CA) who died by 36 months of age from the proportional mortality ratio.- The leading underlying causes of death for children with CZS were multiple congenital malformations not classified elsewhere and unspecified septicemia.What do these findings mean?- The sequence of causes and circumstances involved in the deaths of the CZS children by 36 months age, in Brazil, highlighted the greater vulnerability of these children to infectious and respiratory conditions.- It is necessary to develop evidence-based health protocols and raising awareness of conditions associated with high mortality in children affected by congenital Zika virus infection to guide health professionals responsible for caring for these children.--Communicated by:ProMED[The number of affected children in this study is not insignificant. These finding argue for establishment of protocols going forward in order to quantify the cause of death in these Zika-virus infected children and provide adequate and appropriate treatment for future cases. - Mod.TY][Although the numbers of cases of Zika virus infection are relatively low this year (2023), the virus has not disappeared. Continued surveillance to identify cases is necessary.

After a religious activity in the Ruinas del Cafetal Angerona, [ruins of the Angerona coffee plantation] in the municipality of Artemisa, an outbreak of histoplasmosis took place in the cistern area, with a total of 43 people exposed, of whom only 9 were not infected, and of the 34 who got sick, 7 are children.

Raymundo Verde, Head of the Department of Hygiene and Epidemiology in Artemisa, stated that ""the event took place on 29 Jan 2023, and the study and control of the focus began on 22 Feb 2023, when those affected went to the hospital, before the start of the symptoms, such as headache, muscle pain, intermittent fever... that can appear between 3 and 17 days after exposure.

This infectious disease is produced by the inhalation of spores of the fungus, the causal agent _Histoplasma capsulatum_, present in bat feces, and which can cause pneumonia that is very difficult to treat. In the area of the cisterns or caves there are old water deposits, in whose soil this fungus grows, fertilized by the guano of the mammal and where the affected people had contact.

From the provincial capital, ""35 were exposed and 26 were infected (74.2%), 9 were hospitalized, and the same number remain asymptomatic, under surveillance. Those admitted are receiving care at the San Cristóbal and Artemisa hospitals. 9 sputa and 13 monosera were also taken, which were transferred to the Institute of Tropical Medicine (IPK) for analysis,"" he explained.

The measures in the face of this eventuality, says Verde, are ""the use of the mask on the site, avoiding removing the soil with the presence of feces, avoiding -- above all -- entering the area of the caves as prevention, and in the case of the personnel who work, in the also National Monument located about 6 kilometers [3.7 mi] from the provincial capital, the due moistening of the walls with water and hypochlorite.""

Even, ""a yellow tape has already been placed to contain the passage of people and coordinates with Flora and Fauna to proceed to the closure of the contaminated premises permanently.""

Apparently -- according to the patients themselves --, the authorization to hold this party was obtained from Culture, although it would be more up to Heritage or Flora and Fauna, comments the epidemiologist.

In any case, it is an atypical event, since the people affected are usually geologists and speleologists, or personnel specialized in extracting guano for use as fertilizer.

[Ruinas del Antiguo Cafetal Angerona [ruins of the Angerona coffee plantation] is a tourist site in the municipality of Artemisa, the capital city of Artemisa Province, 65 km southwest of Havana, the capital city of Cuba (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemisa>).

Apparently a religious group held an event at Ruinas del Antiguo Cafetal Angerona. According to one account 43 people were exposed in a cave inhabited by bats to aerosolized _Histoplasma_ spores; of the 43 exposed, 34 became sick with histoplasmosis and 9 were not affected. Another report says that 35 were exposed and 26 were infected (74.2%); 9 were hospitalized, and the same number remain asymptomatic.

_Histoplasma capsulatum_ is a dimorphic fungus that grows in a mycelial form at ambient temperatures and as yeast at body temperature in mammals. It is found worldwide in soil enriched by bird or bat droppings. Contaminated soil can be potentially infectious for years. Fungal spores become airborne during activities that disturb the contaminated soil, such as spelunking, mining, construction, excavation, demolition, roofing, chimney cleaning, farming, or gardening, which can lead to clusters of cases of histoplasmosis that follow inhalation of the aerosolized spores. The spores can travel distances downstream from the source in currents of air.

Because of the presence of bats in caves, cave exploration is a known risk factor for histoplasmosis, which is sometimes known as ""cave fever"" (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10403317>). Physicians should be aware of the association between histoplasmosis and caving when caring for individuals who develop an acute febrile respiratory illness after cave exploration (<http://tinyurl.com/yxjust7x>).

Another disease that has also acquired the name ""cave fever"" is tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF). See ProMED-mail posts Tick-borne relapsing fever - Israel: spelunkers, tourists 20180422.5761531 and Tick-borne relapsing fever - USA: (TX) cave workers, 2017 20180420.5759542.

Although birds cannot be infected by the _H. capsulatum_ and do not transmit the disease, bats can become infected by _H. capsulatum_ and may harbor the fungus in their gut (<https://academic.oup.com/jtm/article/15/2/133/1801173>).

In the US, histoplasmosis is endemic in the Ohio, Missouri, and Mississippi River valleys, where it is caused by _H. capsulatum_ var. _capsulatum_. Histoplasmosis has also been reported in Mexico, Central and South America, Oceania, Asia, Africa, and Europe (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4535725/>). In Africa, histoplasmosis occurs most commonly in west and central Africa, where it is caused by the _duboisii_ variety, which has yeast cells that average about twice the size of _H. capsulatum_ var. _capsulatum_ (<http://www.reviberoammicol.com/1997-14/155159.pdf>).

Most individuals with histoplasmosis are asymptomatic. Those who develop clinical manifestations are usually immunocompromised or are exposed to a large number of spores. Disseminated disease is especially more common in HIV/AIDS co-infected cases. - Mod.ML

Brazil's drug authority Anvisa has approved the registration of a new vaccine against dengue fever. Qdenga, produced by Takeda Pharma, is indicated for people aged 4 through 60. Its administration is subcutaneous, in a scheme of 2 doses with a 3-month interval, Agencia Brasil reports.

The new shot is composed of [all] 4 different serotypes of the virus, which guarantees ample protection. Last year [2022], over 1000 deaths from dengue complications were recorded nationwide.

A month ago [February 2023], the National Technical Commission on Biosafety (CTNBio) confirmed the safety of the Qdenga vaccine, now pending approval by Anvisa.

Qdenga was also authorized by the European Health Agency. The registration granted by Anvisa allows the product to be traded in the country, as long as conditions are maintained. The inoculation, however, will continue to be subject to adverse event monitoring by the company.

Dengvaxia, another dengue vaccine greenlighted in Brazil, can only be given to those who have had the disease [previous dengue virus infection].

The local Animal Care and Health Office said on Thursday [9 Mar 2023] that 3 Formosan ferret-badgers have been confirmed as having had rabies, the 1st time the virus has been detected in Miaoli County.

As part of a program being carried out by the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine to assess the prevalence of rabies among wild animal across Taiwan, 2 Formosan ferret-badgers were captured in Jhuolan Township on 1 and 7 Jan 2023, and a 3rd was caught in Taian Township on 18 Jan 2023, the office said.

The 3 animals died in captivity and were later confirmed by the Animal Health Research Institute as having been infected with the rabies virus, the office said.

The 3 ferret-badgers are the 1st rabies cases discovered north of the Daan River -- which partly defines the Miaoli County-Taichung border -- since 2013, which indicates that the virus is spreading across the river, office Director Chang Chun-yi said.

To prevent rabies from spreading among cats and dogs in the area, the office would go door-to-door to administer free vaccinations for pets, Chang said, adding that residents should have their animals neutered and microchipped.

Animal patrols would be stepped up in the county and the office would capture stray dogs in high-risk areas to be placed in secure facilities and vaccinated against rabies if necessary, he said.

People should report animal carcasses they find to the office, not dispose of them on their own, he added.

Anyone bitten or scratched by a stray animal should clean the wound with soap and water for at least 15 minutes and disinfect the area with 70 percent alcohol before seeking urgent medical treatment and reporting the case to their local township office or animal care facility, the office said.

Miaoli County Commissioner Chung Tung-chin called on the public not to abandon pets and not to touch or catch wild animals.

It is imperative that people take their pets to receive shots every year to help prevent the spread of rabies among animals and thereby ensure it does not jump from animals to humans, Chung said.

Risk evaluation on chikungunya -- Implications for the Region of the Americas as of 7 Mar 2023
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hazard assessment
-----------------
Chikungunya is a viral disease transmitted by the bites of infected female mosquitoes. The vectors most often involved are _Aedes aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_. These 2 species of mosquitoes are also responsible for transmitting other viruses, including dengue fever, urban yellow fever (_Ae. aegypti_), and Zika. Some animals, including non-human primates, rodents, birds, and small mammals can act as reservoirs. When conditions are favourable, the attack rates observed during major epidemics can exceed 30% of the exposed population.

The disease is caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an RNA virus of the family Togaviridae that is clinically characterized by the sudden onset of fever frequently accompanied by severe and debilitating arthralgia or arthritis that varies in duration. Other common signs and symptoms include myalgia, headache, nausea, fatigue, and rash. Severe clinical presentations are uncommon but may contribute to the cause of death in neonates infected during the perinatal period, the elderly, and people with underlying medical conditions. Symptoms in infected people are often mild and the infection may go unrecognized or be misdiagnosed in areas affected by other arboviruses. Uncommon complications include uveitis, retinitis, myocarditis, hepatitis, nephritis, bullous skin lesions, haemorrhage, meningoencephalitis, myelitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and cranial nerve palsies.

There is no specific antiviral treatment or approved vaccine for chikungunya. Treatment is primarily aimed at relieving symptoms, including joint pain, with antipyretics and fluids; infection can provide lifelong immunity. Prevention efforts are highly focused on the control of the disease vectors' populations. In 2013, chikungunya virus was introduced in the Region of the Americas. It has since spread to most areas where the competent vectors are present. The virus can be also transported from one place to another (areas without prior transmission) by infected travellers. Given the high epidemic potential of chikungunya, it is also possible to trigger local transmission in areas with a naive population.

Exposure assessment
--------------------
In the Region of the Americas, between EW 1 and EW 8 of 2023 [1 Jan-25 Feb 2023], a total of 444 895 cases of 3 arboviral diseases were reported. Out of the total cases, 333 112 (75%) were dengue cases, 111 288 (25%) were chikungunya cases, and 495 (0.1%) were Zika cases (1).

In 2022, in the Region of the Americas, the number of cases of chikungunya was over the average number of cases for the previous 4 years (2018-2021), with a total of 263 685 cases including 87 deaths, representing a 2-fold increase in cases and a 7-fold increase in deaths compared with the cases reported in 2021 (137 025 cases, including 12 deaths). During the same period, out of the 14 countries that reported cases, the highest incidence rate of chikungunya cases was reported in Belize with 568.9 cases per 100 000 population, followed by Brazil with 123.9 cases per 100 000 population, and Paraguay with 32.8 cases per 100 000 population. Of the total deaths reported in 2022, all were reported in Brazil (1).

Between EW 1 and EW 8 of 2023, a total of 115 539 cases of chikungunya were reported in the Region of the Americas, including 33 deaths, representing a 5-fold increase in cases and a 4-fold increase in deaths compared with the same period in 2022 (21 887 cases, including 8 deaths). During the same period, out of the 14 countries that reported cases, the highest incidence rate of chikungunya cases was reported in Paraguay with 1127.5 cases per 100,000 population, followed by Brazil with 14.2 cases per 100 000 population, and Belize with 10.4 cases per 100 000 population. Of the total deaths reported in 2023, all were reported in Paraguay (1)

The following section summarizes the epidemiological situation of chikungunya in countries in the Region of the Americas that currently report ongoing very high transmission.

Argentina
Between EW 1 and EW 9 of 2023 [1 Jan-4 Mar 2023], a total of 230 cases of chikungunya were reported in Argentina, of which 198 were laboratory confirmed, with no deaths. During the same period in 2022, no cases of chikungunya were reported. Of the total of cases, 12 have no travel history; these cases were reported in Buenos Aires Province (3 cases) and Buenos Aires City (1 case). Previously, the Buenos Aires Province did not report chikungunya virus circulation. Additionally, 45 confirmed and probable cases are currently under investigation in Buenos Aires Province (23 cases), Buenos Aires City (10 cases), Cordoba (2 cases), Santa Fe (1 case), Chaco (2 cases), Corrientes (1 case), Formosa (2 cases), and Misiones (4 cased); in addition to 173 cases with travel history (classified as imported) which are also under investigation (2, 3).

Bolivia
In 2023, between EW 1 and EW 6 [1 Jan-11 Feb 2023], a total of 300 cases of chikungunya were reported, with no deaths, representing an 8-fold increase in cases compared with the same period in 2022 (38 cases). During the same period, the national cumulative incidence rate was 2.5 cases per 100 000 population. (4).

Brazil
In 2023, between EW 1 and EW 9 [1 Jan-4 Mar 2023], a total of 35 566 probable and confirmed cases of chikungunya were reported in Brazil, including one confirmed death (reported in Espiritu Santo State) and 13 deaths under investigation. During the same period, the national cumulative incidence rate was 16.7 cases per 100 000 population, representing a 109.6% relative increase compared to the same period in 2022. Out of 27 Federal Units, 25 reported cases in 2023: Alagoas, Amazonas, Bahía, Ceará, Distrito Federal, Espíritu Santo, Goiás, Maranhão, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas Gerais, Tocantins, Paraíba, Pará, Paraná, Pernambuco, Piauí, Río de Janeiro, Río Grande do Norte, Río Grande do Sul, Rondônia, Roraima, São Paulo, Sergipe, and Santa Catarina (5, 6). In the Southern region of the country, between EW 1 and EW 9 of 2023, a total of 224 cases were reported with an incidence rate of 0.7 cases per 100 000 population. This represents an increase of 180% when compared to the same period in 2022. An increased trend has been observed since EW 4 [22-28 Jan 2023]; of the total cases reported between EW 1 and EW 9 of 2023, 10.5% were reported in Paraná, 4.7% in Santa Catarina, and 3.2% in Rio Grande do Sul (5, 6).

Paraguay
The 1st autochthonous case of chikungunya in Paraguay was reported in 2015. In 2016, cases were reported mainly in Asuncion and Central departments and in 2018 were reported mainly in Amambay department. Since EW 40 of 2022 [2-8 Oct 2022], an increasing trend of cases has been observed over the historical threshold. Between EW 52 of 2022 and EW 8 of 2023 [25 Dec 2022-25 Feb 2023], a total of 24 659 cases were classified as probable and confirmed, including 2910 hospitalizations and 34 deaths. There have been no reported deaths due to chikungunya during this period in previous years. Of the total cases reported during this period, a high proportion of cases (93%) and deaths (97%) were reported during EW 1 and EW 8 of 2023 (7). Confirmed and probable cases have been reported in 18 regions of the country. The highest number of cases was reported in 2 departments: Central (21 069 cases, including 23 deaths) and Asunción (8754 cases, including 8 deaths). The highest proportion of suspected cases reported was registered in the following departments: Central with 62%, Asunción with 22%, Paraguarí with 3.5%, and Cordillera with 2.5% (7)

Between EW 1 and EW 8 of 2023 [1 Jan-25 Feb 2023], of the total cases reported, 132 were neonates [0 to 28 days of age], including 4 deaths. One infant, whose age was under 31 days old, was also reported among the deaths. During the same period, a total of 219 suspected cases of acute meningoencephalitis were reported, 87 attributed to chikungunya meningoencephalitis*, 38 of which were neonates (7).

In 2015 and 2016, during the 1st outbreaks of chikungunya in Paraguay, the Central Asia lineage was detected. The East/Central/South African (ECSA) lineage was first detected in the country in 2018 during an outbreak in Amambay department. Currently, preliminary genomic sequencing has detected ECSA in 7 samples taken in October 2022 in the Metropolitan area of Asunción (7).

*Classification of the cases was done by RT-PCR in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), those that did not have a RT-PCR result in CSF positive for Chikungunya were classified as having positive PCR results in blood for Chikungunya added to clinical signs compatible with encephalitis. Currently, there is no classification of probable chikungunya encephalitis.

Context assessment
------------------
During the last 3 years, there were 3 concurrent Public Health Emergencies of International Concern (PHEIC) (COVID-19, mpox, and polio) that had a direct impact on the health systems globally, which further weakened the health systems response capacity in countries and territories of the Region of the Americas.

Migration within the Region of the Americas has increased, due to the social, political, and economic situation in several countries and territories. CHIKV can be transported from one place to another (areas without documented transmission) by infected travelers; when competent vectors are present in these new areas, it is possible to trigger local transmission, with high epidemic potential.

Currently, the arboviral disease programs in affected countries do not have enough resources to respond to outbreaks due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This lack of resources has affected all the prevention activities and is now affecting all the control activities. Additionally, personnel who were trained in arbovirus surveillance and response/vector control before the COVID-19 pandemic now require re-training, as most of these personnel had to stop these activities during the pandemic due to the social distancing measures.

Furthermore, according to the chikungunya seasonal pattern, most cases in the southern hemisphere occur in the 1st semester of the year, corresponding with the warmer, rainy summer months. These conditions are favorable for proliferation/reproduction of competent vectors such as _Ae. aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_ which are widely distributed in the Region of the Americas. Therefore, increased transmission activity is expected in the coming months.

The expansion of CHIKV outside of historical areas of transmission represents a risk to immunologically naive populations, including risk groups for severe disease, who may not be aware of clinical manifestations of the disease, including those of severe disease. The identification of extra-articular and/or severe manifestations helps to clinically categorize the illness and decide on proper patient care.

Table 1: Capacities and vulnerabilities related to chikungunya for countries/territories within the Region of the Americas, March 2023

Capacities
- Member States are coordinating at all levels, strengthening epidemiological surveillance, clinical management, laboratory network, risk communication, entomological surveillance, and vector-control activities, as preparedness and/or response to these events.
- In the framework of the implementation of the Integrated Management Strategy for Arbovirus Prevention and Control in the Region of the Americas (IMS-Arbovirus), PAHO/WHO is actively working with Member States in order to strengthen arbovirus prevention and control with an integrated and multidisciplinary approach.
- PAHO/WHO is supporting the implementation of effective integrated vector surveillance and control by Member States through publishing guidelines and surveillance and control materials, including technical assistance to national authorities.
- PAHO/WHO has been supporting the Member States to increase the laboratory capacity.
- PAHO/WHO has been publishing case management guidelines and developing training sessions for healthcare workers.
- PAHO/WHO experts are being deployed to countries that are experiencing high magnitude outbreaks.
- PAHO/ WHO has been supporting Member States with clinical management and organization of health services, vector control, epidemiological surveillance, virological surveillance, and risk communication.
- Some countries have National networks of clinical experts in arboviral diseases, under the direction of the Ministries of Health, which are responsible for conducting training at the local level.
- In 2020, PAHO/WHO began a collaboration with the Andean Health Organization-Hipólito Unanue Agreement (ORASCONHU) to strengthen national technical capacities for the prevention and control of arboviral diseases in Bolivia, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela. This collaboration falls under the framework of the PAHO/WHO Integrated Management Strategy for the Prevention and Control of Arboviral Diseases, approved by Member States.
- Agreements established between ORAS-CONHU and PAHO/WHO allowed for the incorporation of arboviruses in the political agenda and facilitated the development of a proposed 5-year plan for health ministers of the Andean subregion countries in 2022.
- Virtual cooperation spaces have been created as an effort of collaborative integrated epidemiological, entomological, and laboratory surveillance between PAHO and Member States that allow for the automated generation of different epidemiological analyses, situation rooms, and epidemiological bulletins, strengthening the epidemiological surveillance and control of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika.

Vulnerabilities
- Several countries are reporting stockouts of several essential supplies for prevention and control.
- Several countries are reporting a lack of reagents and consumables.
- Some countries are overburdened with concurrent major ongoing outbreaks.
- In some areas, there is a lack of healthcare facilities, added to diverse access barriers.
- Expansion out of historical areas of transmission, where the population is completely immunologically naive.
- Summer in the southern hemisphere is favorable for competent vectors, notably the _Ae. aegypti_, which is widely distributed in the Region of the Americas.
- Field teams in many countries require re-training in vector control, community mobilization, and clinical care/case recognition.
- There are early increases of arbovirus transmission in Central America and the Caribbean. These countries/territories need support in laboratory capacity, strengthening epidemiological and entomological surveillance, and vector control.
- East-Central-South-African (ECSA) lineage was preliminarily detected in Paraguay. This lineage was primarily circulating in southern Brazil previously, expanding its range since 2014. Therefore, it might affect naive populations.
- One country of the Region (Paraguay) is experiencing an unprecedented increase in chikungunya cases, including a high incidence of meningoencephalitis as a severe complication due to chikungunya.
- Lack of family and community participation in activities to eliminate vector breeding sites within the home and around the home.

Spain ex Paraguay. 18 Feb 2023. During the past few weeks, the GeoSentinel Surveillance and Research Network has identified 6 travelers to Paraguay (in and near Asunción) with acute chikungunya [virus infection]. Of the 6, 3 were confirmed by PCR, while the rest had a probable infection with a positive serology (anti-chikungunya IgM). 2 of them were admitted due to severe manifestations of the acute illness, including fever, diarrhea, and vomiting. All 6 traveled to Paraguay to visit friends and relatives between December 2022 and February 2023 and had onset of symptoms either during travel or shortly after returning to Spain.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
_Aedes aegypti_ (Linnaeus, 1762) is the main mosquito vector for dengue and other arboviral infectious diseases [such as chikungunya]. Control of this important vector highly relies on the use of insecticides, especially pyrethroids. The high frequency (>78%) of the L982W substitution was detected at the target site of the pyrethroid insecticide, the voltage-gated sodium channel (Vgsc) of _Ae. aegypti_ collected from Viet Nam and Cambodia. Alleles having concomitant mutations L982W + F1534C and V1016G + F1534C were also confirmed in both countries, and their frequency was high (>90%) in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Strains having these alleles exhibited substantially higher levels of pyrethroid resistance than any other field population ever reported. The L982W substitution has never been detected in any country of the Indochina Peninsula except Viet Nam and Cambodia, but it may be spreading to other areas of Asia, which can cause an unprecedentedly serious threat to the control of dengue fever as well as other _Aedes_-borne infectious diseases.

Discussion
----------
In conclusion, our studies have shown that concomitant L199F + A434T + L982W + F1534C and S989P + V1016G + F1534C of Vgsc confer an eminently higher level of pyrethroid resistance than the previously reported single kdr [Vgsc gene mutations that cause amino acid substitutions and confer pyrethroid resistance are collectively called knockdown resistance or kdr] substitutions F1534C and V1016G. Further experiments to characterize each mutation are necessary. On the other hand, the high frequency of _Ae. aegypti_, having these concomitant mutations in a region of Cambodia, shows the stark fact that threats for controlling dengue and other arboviral infectious diseases are certainly looming. We emphasize the importance of strengthening the monitoring of these mutant alleles, especially in Southeast Asia, to take appropriate countermeasures before they spread globally.

[Widely distributed pyrethroid resistance in Southeast Asia _Ae. aegypti_ is of concern. This mosquito is the main vector of chikungunya, dengue, and Zika viruses and pyrethroids are insecticides commonly used for the control of adult mosquitoes. Control of _Ae. aegypti_ is difficult. Newer approaches for control using genetically modified mosquitoes or the release of sterile males are promising, as is the use of _Wolbachia_ bacteria to block virus infection of these mosquito vectors. - Mod.TY]

Himachal Pradesh Governor Shiv Pratap Shukla on Thursday [9 Mar 2023] sought a report from the vice chancellor of Dr YS Parmar University of Horticulture and Forestry in Nauni on the reported spread of jaundice on the campus. Claiming that jaundice spread on the campus due to the supply of contaminated waters, students lodged a protest on Tuesday [7 Mar 2023].

Taking cognizance of the matter, the governor held a meeting with Vice Chancellor Rajeshwar Singh Chandel and issued instructions to further improve drinking water supply and other facilities for students of the university in Nauni in Solan district. He asked him to thoroughly investigate the real cause behind the spread of jaundice and submit a report. The governor also appealed to the students to maintain peace on the campus and assured that he would personally monitor the issue. During their protest, the students boycotted classes, raised slogans against the university administration, and demanded immediate solution to the problem. They claimed that water tanks are exposed to wild animals, especially monkeys.

[In much of the world, related to poor sewage and sanitation systems, an overwhelming number of the population has had hepatitis A in childhood, often without symptoms or jaundice. The serologic diagnosis of hepatitis A is made by finding positive IgM antibodies against the virus; a single positive IgG antibody against the virus is not diagnostic for acute disease. A variety of other infections could do this, including the hepatitis E virus, which is also mostly waterborne.

The claim that the potable water was exposed to wild animals, especially monkeys, brings up the possibility of leptospirosis, a bacterial infection that can cause hepatitis. It is more often linked to water contaminated with rodent urine. - Mod.LL

An outbreak of a highly contagious and life-threatening bacteria has forced a Miami-Dade County animal shelter to suspend some of its services.

The shelter at Miami-Dade Animal Services in Doral is filled to the brim with dogs, and this is having an unanticipated effect on the 4-legged population.

_Streptococcus equi zooepidemicus_ is the name of a bacteria sweeping through the kennels, and the chief veterinarian for the facility is fighting against time to treat all 500-plus dogs with antibiotics inside a facility meant to house only half as many dogs.

""It is a disease spread through respiratory ways, so it's very easy to transfer it in a place like a shelter,"" said Miami-Dade Animal Services Chief Veterinarian Maria Serrano. ""Dogs having this disease experience fever, lethargy, and respiratory signs such as nasal discharge, and sometimes it comes with blood, sneezing, sometimes with blood.""

So far, 2 dogs have already died from signs consistent with the bacteria, and its why folks at the shelter are trying to get the word out to the community.

""It's not concerning for the health of people, but it is mostly in the dogs confined in a shelter environment,"" said Serrano.

Because of the outbreak, some public services have been suspended, such as an on-site wellness clinic focusing on spaying, neutering, and vaccination services.

Additionally, crews won't respond to stray dog pick-up requests and receiving any new pets on-site via drop-off is temporarily off limits.

The shelter is focused on urgently reducing the pet population within the kennels to curb the threat.

""If anybody can help us, it would be fostering and adopting any of these dogs,"" said Serrano. ""Again, all of our population is going to be treated, so they're going to be protected.""

Increased water testing protocols are in effect at The Christ Hospital in Mt. Auburn after 3 patients recently tested positive for the presence of _Legionella_, according to a hospital spokesperson.

_Legionella_ is ""a common organism routinely found in the public water supply,"" the spokesperson said late Friday [10 Mar 2023]. 

It isn't clear whether those patients are diagnosed with Legionnaires' disease, a serious type of pneumonia caused by _Legionella_ bacteria. The hospital has not determined where the patients contracted the bacteria. It is currently investigating to identify any potential hospital sources.

""Out of an abundance of caution, we have deployed bottled water for use with patient care, staff, and guests while additional water filters are being installed throughout the hospital over the weekend,"" the spokesperson said. ""We have an extensive water treatment program in place and will continue to adhere to advanced safety protocols and guidelines in coordination with City of Cincinnati Department of Health and the Ohio Department of Health. We continue with normal hospital operations with no interruption to patient care.""

[The Christ Hospital is a 531-bed, not-for-profit acute care teaching hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio (<https://www.ahd.com/free_profile/360163/The_Christ_Hospital_/Cincinnati/Ohio/>).

_Legionella_, a Gram-negative bacillus, usually causes pneumonia in certain ""at-risk"" people who either have inhaled aerosolized organisms from contaminated water sources or have aspirated water contaminated with this organism. The news article reports that the 3 patients who ""recently tested positive for the presence of _Legionella_"" presumably were not admitted from the community with pneumonia, but developed pneumonia sometime after hospitalization, since they are ""investigating to identify any potential hospital sources.""

_Legionella_ are found in both natural freshwater environments, such as lakes and streams, and manufactured plumbing systems. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 deg C (77-104 deg F) support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems. During the epidemiological and environmental investigation for the source of _Legionella_ organisms, patients should be prohibited from taking showers and should use sterile or boiled water for drinking, tooth brushing, and mouth rinsing until the source has been remediated.

Also, the news article reports that ""it isn't clear whether those patients are diagnosed with Legionnaires' disease, a serious type of pneumonia caused by _Legionella_ bacteria."" However, the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease is usually made by identifying _Legionella_ in respiratory tract secretions or more commonly by identifying _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1 antigen in the urine. If a patient has pneumonia and either the respiratory secretions are positive for _Legionella_ or the _Legionella_ urinary antigen test is positive, then the patient has Legionnaires' disease. _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 is responsible for the majority of these infections.

Genotyping the isolates from patients with Legionnaires' disease will help establish whether this is a common source outbreak, if the genotypes match. However, if the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ will identify the environmental source for the individual cases. Because _Legionella_ may be found in water supplies without linkage to any cases, the actual causative source should be demonstrated by matching the genotype of the environmental isolates with that of clinical isolates (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC86783/> and <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730281/>).

More information on the outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML

The news article reports that the 3 patients who ""recently tested positive for the presence of _Legionella_"" presumably were not admitted from the community with pneumonia, but developed pneumonia sometime after hospitalization, since they are ""investigating to identify any potential hospital sources.""_Legionella_ are found in both natural freshwater environments, such as lakes and streams, and manufactured plumbing systems. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 deg C (77-104 deg F) support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems. During the epidemiological and environmental investigation for the source of _Legionella_ organisms, patients should be prohibited from taking showers and should use sterile or boiled water for drinking, tooth brushing, and mouth rinsing until the source has been remediated.Also, the news article reports that ""it isn't clear whether those patients are diagnosed with Legionnaires' disease, a serious type of pneumonia caused by _Legionella_ bacteria."" However, the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease is usually made by identifying _Legionella_ in respiratory tract secretions or more commonly by identifying _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1 antigen in the urine. If a patient has pneumonia and either the respiratory secretions are positive for _Legionella_ or the _Legionella_ urinary antigen test is positive, then the patient has Legionnaires' disease. _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 is responsible for the majority of these infections.Genotyping the isolates from patients with Legionnaires' disease will help establish whether this is a common source outbreak, if the genotypes match. However, if the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ will identify the environmental source for the individual cases. Because _Legionella_ may be found in water supplies without linkage to any cases, the actual causative source should be demonstrated by matching the genotype of the environmental isolates with that of clinical isolates (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC86783/> and <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730281/>).More information on the outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.MLProMED map:Ohio, United States: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8708904,237>]",FOX 19,,

[In the past week, Australia, South Korea, and the USA have ended their requirement for travellers from China, Macau, and Hong Kong to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 PCR test.

SBS.com.au reported that Australia had re-enforced pre-departure testing for arrivals from Hong Kong and Macau in January 2023, in what the Australian government said was out of ""an abundance of caution"" as China grappled with a significant virus wave. But Health Minister Mark Butler has revealed the measure will be lifted on 11 Mar 2023, saying the hospitalisations in China had peaked in late December 2022 and early January 2023 (<https://www.health.gov.au/ministers/the-hon-mark-butler-mp/media/end-of-covid-19-predeparture-requirement-in-china>).

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed on 8 Mar 2023 it plans to end mandatory COVID-19 tests for travelers from China, joining other countries in eliminating the requirements, Reuters reported on 9 Mar 2023.

The Standard reported that starting 11 Mar 2023, people traveling from Hong Kong, Macau, and mainland China to South Korea will no longer have to take a COVID-19 test before entering the country. The Korean health authority announced on 8 Mar 2023 that the pre-departure test results required from anyone traveling from the 3 regions will be lifted. - Mod.LWW]

[B] USA ends national public health emergency for COVID-19
Date: Thu 2 Mar 2023
Source: The American Journal of Managed Care [abridged, edited]
<https://www.ajmc.com/view/end-of-the-national-public-health-emergency-for-covid-19-what-does-it-mean-for-the-public->


At the end of January [2023], President Joe Biden announced that the national public health emergency called in 2020 for COVID-19 would officially end on 11 May 2023, more than 3 years after it was first implemented. The news sparked immediate discussion on how this would change the way COVID-19 treatments, vaccines, and testing will be accessed throughout the United States as government funding would no longer extend to certain areas of need.

According to Kaiser Health News, many policies that were designed to fight the spread of the virus will end come 11 May 2023. For example, vaccines that were previously purchased by the government will remain available for low or no cost as long as the supplies last. However, once that supply runs out, Pfizer has indicated that the prices for the booster will increase to USD 110 to USD 130 per dose, which could translate to billions of dollars of revenue for the manufacturers that consumers would be responsible for; Moderna has since announced that its booster will remain free for the time being.

When Biden announced his intention to terminate the national public health emergency, several news outlets covered the potential immediate effects of the change. While some things have changed in the month after his announcement, many of the immediate concerns remain the same.

An immediate concern was access to vaccines and their price point once the national emergency ends. In the month since Biden's announcement, Moderna announced that it would continue to offer its vaccine for free for those who are uninsured. Because of that, Halkitis believes that vaccine access will not be an issue going forward and will not be majorly affected. However, accessibility and affordability of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) will largely depend on the federal supply that has been previously purchased, which would make continued use of this medication a long-term issue.

Telemedicine was also nearly up on the chopping block, but Congress recently passed a bill that would allow current Medicare reimbursement levels for telemedicine to continue through 2024.

However, a change that will be felt immediately is that the government will no longer mail free COVID-19 tests to households through the United States Postal Service. For the past 3 years, all American residents were able to apply through a government website and have rapid COVID-19 tests delivered to their mailbox. With the ending of the national public health emergency, this program will cease to exist.

According to Kaiser Health News, out-of-pocket payments for testing will start in May [2023], as Medicare beneficiaries and individuals with private, employer-based insurance will not be able to receive rapid antigen tests for free through government programs.

Another major area of concern is Medicaid redetermination. Due to the national public health emergency, US citizens could not be disenrolled from Medicaid, regardless of eligibility.

""Starting 1 Apr 2023, states have the option to start to unwind and start to disenroll people who don't appear eligible,"" said [John Graves, associate professor of health policy at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine]. ""That's [not only] going to predominantly affect people in Medicaid, obviously, but probably people with the most variable incomes....They got on at some point, maybe because they lost their job during COVID-19, and they've been able to continue along without having to prove eligibility every year since.""

McEvoy said that the expectation is that at least 70 million individuals on the program will remain eligible, which is an overwhelming majority of the estimated 90 million individuals covered by Medicaid. However, this would still leave up to 20 million without Medicaid coverage starting next month [April 2023].

With all these major changes coming as soon as next month [April 2023], the challenge is knowing how to combat the issues that will arise from loss of access to testing, treatment, and even health care.

While vaccine and treatment access is not going to be an immediate concern, future access when supply runs short will be heavily contingent on access to health care coverage and help for the uninsured. With Medicaid redetermination set to leave millions without coverage, it's important to make sure that these individuals are not left without help in the long term.

While there are ways to address some of the primary areas of concern with the national public health emergency ending, experts stress the importance of remaining vigilant about these issues going forward, especially regarding the mindset of both patients and health care providers.

The end of the national public health emergency spells significant changes in the way that health care and insurance have operated for the past 3 years. With proper information and communication, as well as preparation for similar events that could occur in the future, it appears possible to mitigate some of the worst outcomes. Preparing for the end of the national public health emergency and acknowledging the continued presence of the COVID-19 virus will continue to dictate future progress after the emergency officially ends.

[C] Singapore releases white paper on COVID-19 response
Date: Wed 8 Mar 2023
Source: Singapore Prime Minister's Office [abridged, edited]
<https://www.pmo.gov.sg/Newsroom/Release-on-White-Paper-on-Singapore-response-to-COVID-19>


White Paper on Singapore's response to COVID-19: Preparing Singapore better for the next pandemic
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The [Singaporean] government has released the White Paper on Singapore's Response to COVID-19, in the wake of Singapore stepping down its remaining COVID-19 measures and moving into a new endemic COVID-19 normal.

Reviewing our experience
------------------------
What we did well
Relative to other countries, Singapore has done well in protecting both lives and livelihoods. We maintained the resilience of our healthcare system and successfully vaccinated the population. The assistance rendered to businesses helped them stay afloat. Livelihoods were preserved through support schemes for self-employed persons as well as skills training and job placements for displaced workers. As a result, we averted a deeper economic crisis. We also kept our air, port and land links open so global supply chains could continue to flow to and through Singapore and the region.

The pandemic affected daily life. Many Singaporeans experienced severe life stressors at home and at work. Public and private organisations worked hand-in-hand to offer additional financial, social and mental well-being support to the vulnerable. We continued educating our students throughout the pandemic, avoiding the severe learning disruption faced by students in other countries. Most of all, there was a high level of trust in fighting this pandemic together -- between the government and people, amongst individuals and communities.

What we could have done better
There were also areas where we could have done better, in particular, the outbreak in the migrant worker dormitories during the early months of the crisis which could have spiralled out of control and overwhelmed our healthcare system. Another was our ability to scale contact tracing efforts to keep pace with the intensity and pace of outbreaks. The TraceTogether (TT) programme faced slow adoption initially, and suffered a setback with the disclosure that TT data could be used for criminal investigations following earlier reassurances that the data would only be used for contact tracing.

The government could have also been less definitive in its initial position on mask-wearing, and more flexible in its implementation of safe management measures. The constantly changing rules were frustrating for businesses and individuals. The switch to home recovery also happened too quickly, causing significant anxiety among infected individuals and their family members.

Finally, on border measures, we had to make difficult decisions around whether to close the borders, whom the restrictions should apply to and thereafter, when to reopen borders. On hindsight, we could have tightened borders more aggressively when confronted with signs of the virus spreading rapidly elsewhere, as well as eased them earlier as soon as it was clear that the main danger would no longer be from imported cases.

These issues have prompted reflection on the important lessons to be drawn from our COVID-19 experience. Where we have done well, we will cement these gains for the future. Where there have been shortcomings in our response, we will identify and tackle them, to be better prepared for the next pandemic.

Lessons for the next pandemic
-----------------------------
The White Paper distils what we have learnt from COVID-19 into 7 key lessons.

a. We need to better establish upfront which dimension to prioritise in each phase of dealing with the pandemic, and to adapt more quickly to the changing situation. Our crisis response should strike the right balance between precision and ease of implementation, and we should not let the perfect be the enemy of the good.

b. We need to strengthen Singapore's resilience as an economy, society, and nation. We should maintain access to key resources by building buffers, invest in critical systems and capabilities to marshal our resources well, and enhance the adaptability of our infrastructure and workforce so we can pivot quickly when we need to.

c. We should deepen engagements and strengthen partnerships with the people and private sectors to harness their strengths. To do this well, the government must develop an eco-system to support and nurture these relationships in peacetime.

d. We should expand our healthcare capacity and strengthen public health expertise and organisational capabilities, especially in communicable disease control and management.

e. Science and technology ought to be better leveraged to support future pandemic crisis management and response. We need to invest in data engineering capabilities and interoperable systems across government, as well as enhance the cybersecurity of our systems.

f. The pandemic emphasised the need for the government to strengthen its structures and capabilities for crisis planning and management. In particular, the range of baseline scenarios for pandemic planning will need to be broadened.

g. Throughout the pandemic, clear and transparent public communications kept citizens informed and reassured, and psychologically prepared for what lay ahead. We will build on this foundation, and consider how else public communications could be leveraged to shape the national psyche in support of important shifts during a crisis.

In this crisis of a generation, we mounted a strong whole-of-nation response. The public, private, and people sectors banded together to deliver the best outcomes for our people and country. From healthcare workers and other essential personnel working on the frontlines, to private companies and community organisations who contributed their time and resources, as well as the many ground-up groups and volunteers who stepped forward to provide support to those in need -- all went beyond the call of duty.

The government would like to put on record our appreciation for the dedication and sacrifices of all who were a part of our multi-year fight against COVID-19. We also thank all Singaporeans for displaying considerable fortitude in abiding by the measures imposed at different phases of the pandemic.

Members of [the] public may access the White Paper at <go.gov.sg/covid-19-white-paper>. The White Paper will be debated in Parliament later this month [March 2023].

[2] Multiorgan involvement of COVID-19
Date: Mon 6 Mar 2023
Source: Newsroom Odisha [edited]
<https://newsroomodisha.com/covid-virus-can-have-lasting-effects-on-nearly-every-organ-for-years-cdc/>


Emerging evidence suggests that COVID virus can have lasting effects on nearly every organ and organ system of the body weeks, months and potentially years after infection, an updated [US] Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance for certifying deaths due to coronavirus disease has revealed.

In the acute phase, clinical manifestations and complications of COVID-19 of varying degrees have been documented, including death.

However, patients who recover from the acute phase of the infection can still suffer long-term effects, commonly referred to as ""long COVID"".

Now, the expanded CDC guidance suggests that documented serious post-COVID conditions include cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurological, renal, endocrine, haematological, and gastrointestinal complications as well as death.

""For decedents, who had a previous SARSCoV-2 infection and were diagnosed with a post-COVID condition, the certifier may consider the possibility that the death was due to long-term complications of COVID-19, even if the original infection occurred months or years before death,"" according to the updated Vital Statistics Reporting Guidance.

In some cases, survival from COVID can be complicated by pre-existing chronic conditions, especially those that result in diminished lung capacity, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma.

These medical conditions do not cause COVID-19, but can increase the risk of contracting a respiratory infection and death, said the CDC guidance.

Long COVID has also been associated with reduced brain oxygen levels, worse performance on cognitive tests and increased psychiatric symptoms such as depression and anxiety, according to new research from the University of Waterloo in Canada.

At least 65 million people are thought to have long COVID, according to a latest review of 200 COVID-19 studies published in Nature Reviews Microbiology journal.

The US-based researchers estimate that the condition is present in 10% of more than 651 million COVID-19 cases that have been documented worldwide.

[3] COVID pill is first to cut short positive-test time after infection
Date: Fri 3 Mar 2023

<https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00548-6>


COVID pill is first to cut short positive-test time after infection
-------------------------------------------------------------------
COVID-19 can inflict days of misery, even on people who do not develop serious illness. Now, trial data show that an antiviral called ensitrelvir shortens symptoms of mild to moderate COVID-19 by about a day -- and is the 1st drug to make a statistically significant cut to the number of days people test positive for SARS-CoV-2.

The drug's manufacturer, Shionogi in Osaka, Japan, says the data also show that ensitrelvir has the potential to prevent long COVID. But scientists are sceptical about that claim and critical of the design of the clinical trial. The research was presented at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) in Seattle, Washington, on 21 Feb 2023, and has not yet been peer reviewed.

Two oral antivirals are already widely used to treat COVID-19: Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) and molnupiravir. Both target people who are at high risk of severe disease. But ensitrelvir was tested on people irrespective of their risk, which could have implications for its use in individuals at low risk. No drug has been conclusively shown to reduce the risk of long COVID, although preliminary evidence hints that Paxlovid might have this effect.

A pill for COVID cough
----------------------
Organizers of the ensitrelvir trial investigated roughly 1200 people, with the main goal of determining whether the drug could accelerate recovery. The results showed that participants who took 125-milligram ensitrelvir pills recovered from 5 specific symptoms -- stuffy or runny nose, sore throat, cough, feeling hot or feverish and low energy or tiredness -- about 24 hours earlier than did those in the control group.

Participants who took the 125-milligram dose also tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 about 29 hours earlier than did those who took a placebo. According to Shionogi, the study was the first to show a statistically significant reduction in the time to a negative test result.

A subset of participants were asked about their COVID-19 symptoms 3 and 6 months after trial enrolment as well as during their acute infection period. Those who reported 2 or more of the same symptoms at least twice in a row over this period were defined as having developed long COVID. Participants who had a relatively high number of symptoms during the illness's early stages had a 14% risk of developing long COVID if they took the antiviral, compared with a 26% risk for similar participants in the placebo group. This led Shionogi to conclude that participants who received ensitrelvir had a reduced risk of developing long COVID.

Doubts about design
-------------------
But scientists who were not involved with the study point out that the trial was not specifically intended to investigate the risk of long COVID. That means that the pre-trial research plan didn't describe any methods for analysing long COVID data.

This means, for example, that it's unclear whether Shionogi's definition of long COVID was determined before the trial began, notes physician Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in San Diego, California. Because this was an exploratory phase of the study, it's not possible to make any strong conclusions, he adds.

Simon Portsmouth, head of clinical development at Shionogi in Florham Park, New Jersey, says that the company could not specify the plan for analysing long COVID data ahead of time because long COVID was less clearly defined in the past than now. He says that these results, although not definitive, will shape an ongoing trial evaluating ensitrelvir's effect on COVID-19 symptoms.

Scientists say it's plausible that antivirals could prevent long COVID. One recent analysis found that people who took Paxlovid had a reduced risk of developing long COVID compared with those who took no antiviral drugs. The study, published as a preprint [<https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.03.22281783v1>], has not yet been peer reviewed. Co-author Ziyad Al-Aly, chief of research and development at the VA St Louis Health Care System, in Missouri, says the ensitrelvir data make him more optimistic that attacking the virus early during an infection ""seems to hold the key to reducing the risk of long COVID"".

Topol agrees that the data that Shionogi has made public support the idea that antivirals protect against long COVID, at least when residual virus is involved in causing prolonged symptoms.

Lingering questions
-------------------
But there's no consensus that persistent virus causes long COVID. ""It's entirely possible that the virus has nothing to do with long COVID,"" says Edward Mills, a health researcher at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada. Long COVID might be caused, for example, by the immune response to the virus, he notes.

The optimal study to investigate whether antivirals prevent long COVID would involve selecting only participants whose disease might be caused in part by lingering SARS-CoV-2, says immunologist Danny Altmann at Imperial College London. If scientists don't separate out such people from those whose symptoms don't have the same cause, trials could yield ""murky answers"", Altmann says.

[4] Close viral relative to COVID detected in humans in Southeast Asia
Date: Mon 6 Mar 2023
Source: The Telegraph [edited]
<https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/close-viral-relative-covid-detected-humans-southeast-asia/>


More than 10% of people in rural Myanmar have been exposed to SARS-like coronaviruses, including RaTG13, scientists have warned, including one of COVID-19's closest known viral relatives.

Between 2017 and 2020, researchers screened the blood of almost 700 people across the country, and found that 12% had at some point been infected with a diverse range of sarbecoviruses -- a group of coronaviruses which includes SARS and SARS-CoV-2.

Many of these viruses had never previously been detected in humans, demonstrating how many unknown pathogens are lurking in bats and wildlife.

This includes RaTG13, which shares 96% of its genetic make-up with SARS-CoV-2. Among a set of 70 samples taken from people working in elephant logging camps, 32% had been exposed to RaTG13 -- which was first found in bat caves in Yunnan, China, a province which borders Myanmar.

There were no signs of human-to-human transmission of these viruses, but experts said the paper -- published in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases -- further demonstrates the regularity of spillover events and the need for strong surveillance systems to prevent outbreaks turning into epidemics.

""Importantly, [the study] confirms that there's an ongoing risk of spillover of SARS-like viruses,"" said Prof David Robertson, of the University of Glasgow's Centre for Virus Research, who was not involved in the study. ""This paper also confirms the risk of direct spillover from bats without the need for an intermediate species.""

He added that it is significant that the majority of people exposed to the virus worked or hunted in remote, forested areas -- often in close proximity with bats. None of the samples taken from central Yangon, the Myanmar's largest city, had been exposed to sarbecoviruses.

""These spillovers in rural areas tend to not spread as there's unlikely to be a large enough population to sustain chains of transmission,"" Prof Robertson said. ""That's why a city like Wuhan was so significant for being the start of the pandemic, as there's lots of opportunity for further human to human spread.""

Previous research has also highlighted just how frequently pathogens jump from wildlife to people in the region. A study from 2020 detected 6 completely new coronaviruses in bats in Myanmar, while modelling has suggested that 66 000 people are infected with coronaviruses every year across Southeast Asia.

As well as ensuring strong biosecurity in laboratories, experts said that more needs to be done to mitigate the threat posed by novel SARS-like viruses circulating in wildlife.

""Our findings underpin the critical importance of continued surveillance at the rural wildlife-human interface in Southeast Asia, where some of the highest levels of known mammalian diversity exist and where future emergence of zoonotic diseases is likely,"" the study said.

The research, which took place before the 1st documented cases of COVID-19 in Myanmar and well before the coup in 2021, found no evidence of previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2.

""Humans are exposed to animal viruses on a daily basis, particularly where the interaction with wildlife is strongest,"" added Prof Eddie Holmes, an evolutionary biologist and virologist at the University of Sydney.

""Any one of these is a potential pandemic event. Fortunately, in nearly every one of these cases the conditions are not right [for] the virus to take off -- either it can't replicate well in human cells, transmit in the human population, or it emerges in a population that is so small that it quickly burns out. But these are the events that fuel pandemics.""

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
""Background
----------
""Sarbecoviruses are a subgenus of Coronaviridae that mostly infect bats with known potential to infect humans (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2). Populations in Southeast Asia, where these viruses are most likely to emerge, have been under-surveyed to date.

""Methods
-------
""We surveyed communities engaged in extractive industries and bat guano harvesting from rural areas in Myanmar. Participants were screened for exposure to sarbecoviruses and their interactions with wildlife were evaluated to determine factors associated with exposure to sarbecoviruses.

""Results
-------
""Of 693 people screened between July 2017 and February 2020, 12.1% were seropositive for sarbecoviruses. Individuals were significantly more likely to have been exposed to sarbecoviruses if their main livelihood involved working in extractive industries (logging, hunting, or harvesting of forest products; OR = 2.71, P = 0.019) or had been hunting/slaughtering bats (OR = 6.09, P = 0.020). Exposure to a range of bat and pangolin sarbecoviruses were identified.

""Conclusions
-----------
""Exposure to diverse sarbecoviruses among high-risk human communities provides epidemiologic and immunologic evidence that zoonotic spillover is occurring. These findings inform risk mitigation efforts needed to decrease disease transmission at the bat-human interface as well as future surveillance efforts warranted to monitor isolated populations for viruses with pandemic potential."" - Mod.LWW]

Daily and weekly case numbers reflect the size of COVID-19 epidemics and testing/reporting requirements in each country or territory. These may vary based on national or local responses and anti-epidemic measures in place during the reporting period. In general, there is significant underreporting of cases worldwide and likely to be driven by the testing of medically attended, symptomatic cases.

The Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) VHF laboratory confirmed 12 Rift Valley fever (RVF) human cases on 1 Mar 2023, the World Health Organization reports.

The 12 cases were reported in the greater Mbarara areas (Mbarara district, Mbarara City, Kazo and Isingiro districts). There are 9 human cases in the sub-county of Rwanyamahembe, Mbarara district, 1 human case in Nyakayojo, Mbarara City linked to Mbarara City Abattoir, 1 human case in the Isingiro district and 1 human case in the Kazo district.

Rift Valley fever is a mosquito-borne virus that is endemic in parts of Africa. It primarily infects animals like sheep, cattle and goats and it can have an economic impact on a community due to the loss of livestock.

Humans get infected through contact with infected animal blood or organs. Butchering and slaughtering of animals is a primary cause of transmission to humans. Certain occupations are at a higher risk of getting Rift Valley fever like farmers, herders and veterinarians.

It can also be transmitted to humans through mosquito bites and the bites of blood-sucking flies.

Most cases of Rift Valley fever are mild and symptoms include fever, headaches and muscle pain. However, a small percentage of people can get serious disease which includes retinitis, encephalitis and a hemorrhagic fever. Fatalities happen in less than 1% of those infected.

[Rift Valley fever virus transmission is again active in Uganda, with 12 new cases reported across 3 districts. One hopes that teams will be dispatched to the affected areas to inform the people to avoid contact with infected animals and their meat and milk products. As mentioned in previous posts, Rift Valley fever virus is endemic in Uganda, and human cases occur there sporadically. The above report makes no mention of cases of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in domestic animals in the area where the human cases occurred. Farm animals are the main reservoirs and amplifiers of RVF virus. RVF outbreaks very often involve significant numbers of ill and dead small ruminant animals. It is odd that no small ruminant animal cases are mentioned, unless the animals had been vaccinated previously and are immune.

RVF virus can persist for a long time in some areas, maintained in _Aedes_ vector mosquitoes that deposit eggs in seasonally-flooded areas, where those eggs are transovarially infected with the virus. Adult female mosquitoes coming from infected eggs can transmit the virus during their 1st blood meals. Eradicating the virus from these areas is not possible with current technology.

As Mod.AB noted: ""Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a major zoonotic disease caused by a virus of the genus _Phlebovirus_ of the family _Bunyaviridae_. The virus affects different animal species (buffaloes, camels, cattle, goats, and sheep) and can pass to humans either by direct contact through blood or body fluids during slaughter or ingestion of contaminated meat or indirectly through arthropod biting, especially by mosquitoes of the genus _Aedes_."" - Mod.TY

Papuan babies believed to have died of measles, one suspected case in Samoa
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
As many as 15 children under the age of 5 in Central Papua have reportedly died of measles.
 
Parish Priest of Christ the Redeemer Church in Timeepa, Yeskiel Belau, told Jubi TV he estimated the number to be higher because there were areas that had not been checked.
 
The data obtained by the Church stated as many as 83 children in his ministry area alone had had measles, he said.
 
""In the parish centre, there are 5 kombas (base communities). The 15 children who died were only from the 5 commanders. Excluding the Toubai, Degadai, Megai Dua, Abaugi, and Dioudimi Stations. If the number is added, it will surely explode,"" he said.
 
Timeepa Health Center head Yoki Butu said his party was conducting post-handover services for the Measles and Rubella (MR) vaccine by the Acting Dogiyai Regent, Petrus Agapa, to prevent measles in Dogiyai District.
 
His party immediately administered drugs to the targeted babies, he said.
 
""Our immunisation coverage has been carried out, in my service area there are only 4 villages and we have done that,"" Yoki said.
 
Regarding the death of the 15 toddlers, Jubi TV reported Yoki said the measles case was not only in the Dogiyai area but was currently the concern of all parties because it had become an 'extraordinary event' in Central Papua Province.
 
""So let's join hands to break the chain of transmission,"" he said.
 
Measles is a serious viral infection, which can spread to others via coughing and sneezing.
 
Samoan baby admitted to hospital
--------------------------------
In Samoa, an 11-month-old baby has been admitted to hospital suspected of measles.
 
Director-General of Health Aiono Dr Alec Ekeroma told TV1 Samoa the infant was showing symptoms of measles and had been isolated to await results of blood samples sent to New Zealand.
 
He confirmed 2 other patients were tested recently and returned negative results.
 
The Ministry of Health were continuing the Mumps Measles and Rubella vaccination push around the country, according to Aiono.
 
""We've approved the payment of staff overtime to allow for them to work Saturdays,"" he said.
 
It had been 3 weeks since the MMR immunisation campaign started and they had reached 85% of babies with the 1st dosage, Aiono said.
 
The 2nd dosage was only at 45& coverage, and Aiono urged parents to push for their children to be fully vaccinated with both doses.
 
""We hope to reach 80% coverage with the 2nd dose by June [2023],"" he said.
 
Meanwhile, the latest test results are expected next week.

[80% coverage with 2 doses of the vaccine is still not sufficiently high to protect the population from virus spread. Measles is so infectious that an estimated 95% of a population needs to be fully vaccinated to achieve herd immunity. The remaining 5% are protected since with 95% of the population immune, measles is unlikely to be able to spread. - Mod.LK

The Ministry of Health announces the registration of measles cases in Nouakchott
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Mauritanian Ministry of Health announced the registration of several cases of measles in a number of children in 3 departments in the capital, Nouakchott.

Director General of Public Health at the Ministry of Health, Mohamed Mahmoud Ould Eal Mahmoud, said in a statement published by the ministry that the cases that were registered had a number of incompletely vaccinated children.

The Director of Public Health added that the registration of more than 3 cases of the disease is considered an epidemic, and it is dealt with quickly and in an appropriate manner, as a state of emergency was announced, and health teams met in the concerned areas, and identified the areas that will be included in the intervention.

He pointed out that the last case of measles disease was recorded in Mauritania in the year 2018. He talked about the registration of cases of infection recently, but in some families coming from some neighboring countries and it was later found that their children had not previously received the vaccine against the disease.

He emphasized that the measles vaccine remains incomplete, both in terms of availability and effectiveness, because it often protects 85% of the vaccinated against this disease.

Weld Eal Mahmoud said in his statement that the health sector is working on introducing a new dose of the measles vaccine by the end of March [2023], and the date will be determined for each child at the age of 15 months.

[This report states that the ""measles vaccine [MMR] remains incomplete... because it often protects 85% of the vaccinated against disease."" However, the MMR vaccine is more effective than that. According to CDC, 2 doses of MMR vaccine are about 97% effective at preventing measles; one dose is about 93% effective. It's not surprising that a number of cases had incomplete vaccination. CDC recommends children get 2 doses of the MMR vaccine, starting with the 1st dose at 12 through 15 months of age, and the 2nd dose at 4 through 6 years of age. Before the measles vaccination program started in 1963, an estimated 3 to 4 million people got measles each year (in the United States). Of these, approximately 500 000 cases were reported each year to CDC; 400 to 500 died, 48 000 were hospitalized, and 1000 developed encephalitis (brain swelling) from measles. Since then, widespread use of the measles virus-containing vaccine has led to a greater than 99% reduction in measles cases compared with the pre-vaccine era. - Mod.LK

He talked about the registration of cases of infection recently, but in some families coming from some neighboring countries and it was later found that their children had not previously received the vaccine against the disease.He emphasized that the measles vaccine remains incomplete, both in terms of availability and effectiveness, because it often protects 85% of the vaccinated against this disease.Weld Eal Mahmoud said in his statement that the health sector is working on introducing a new dose of the measles vaccine by the end of March [2023], and the date will be determined for each child at the age of 15 months.[Byline: Ahmed Ould El Hassan] --Communicated by:ProMED[This report states that the ""measles vaccine [MMR] remains incomplete... because it often protects 85% of the vaccinated against disease."" However, the MMR vaccine is more effective than that. According to CDC, 2 doses of MMR vaccine are about 97% effective at preventing measles; one dose is about 93% effective. It's not surprising that a number of cases had incomplete vaccination. CDC recommends children get 2 doses of the MMR vaccine, starting with the 1st dose at 12 through 15 months of age, and the 2nd dose at 4 through 6 years of age. Before the measles vaccination program started in 1963, an estimated 3 to 4 million people got measles each year (in the United States). Of these, approximately 500 000 cases were reported each year to CDC; 400 to 500 died, 48 000 were hospitalized, and 1000 developed encephalitis (brain swelling) from measles. Since then, widespread use of the measles virus-containing vaccine has led to a greater than 99% reduction in measles cases compared with the pre-vaccine era. - Mod.LKProMED map of Nouakchott Capital District, Mauritania: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8708895,25050>]","RNZ, Sahara Media",,

[ANA] died this Friday afternoon [10 Mar 2023] in intensive care in the San Carlos de Bariloche Sanatorium after having been infected with hantavirus, stated the Technical Secretary of IV Health Zone, Dr Victor Parodi. The patient was 45 years old and was a teacher in the Hormiguitas nursery school in this city [Bariloche]. Parodi said that personnel from the Regional Environmental Health Unit (Uresa) are investigating to determine how and where the infection occurred.

Parodi said that the IgM and PCR hantavirus studies, that were carried out on the blood samples taken from the patient, were positive and confirmed the infection. He reported that it was decided to isolate [ANA's] close contacts as a preventive measure. The isolation will be continued for 40 days because the symptoms can appear in people during that period.

Sources from the sanatorium told Rio Negro that the patient was admitted in ""very bad condition"" on Wednesday [8 Mar 2023] and was immediately admitted to the Intensive Care Unit. They indicated that doctors interviewed a direct relative of the woman who reported that [ANA] had not been collecting firewood or been in sheds. Therefore, where and when the infection occurred is under investigation.

Parodi explained that the results of the PCR study were sent to the Malbrán Institute to identify if it is the same virus type that was detected some time ago in the Andean zone or if it is another subtype. The death of the teacher caused numerous expressions of pain in the community of this city.

Neuquén and Chubut are considered endemic areas because cases can appear at any time of the year, although at some point there may be a more intense outbreak. Rodents, known as long-tailed rodents, live in this vast area and are the natural reservoir of the virus.

In the Epuyen locality in Chubut, there was an outbreak between December 2018 and early 2019, which caused 11 deaths. In 1996 in Bariloche and El Bolsón, another outbreak occurred that left several people dead.

Parodi admitted that, for now, ""we do not have a specific place where the patient could have been infected."" He explained that you have to find from family and friends where the infection occurred. They are checking for up to 45 days prior to the manifestation of symptoms.

He pointed out that although hantavirus has a mortality rate that exceeds 50%, there are many cases that evolve favorably. He insisted that it is an endemic area, as is the case in other regions of the country that have other viruses. The doctor asserted that it is the 1st death caused by a hantavirus [infection] so far this year [2023].

He explained that the people who had contact with the patient 48 hours before the symptoms appeared were isolated and reiterated that they must comply with 40 days of strict isolation because in that period the symptoms can manifest.

In any case, he clarified that as of this Saturday morning [11 Mar 2023] no infected person had been reported among close contacts. He argued that if anyone does not comply with the days of isolation from Public Health, they will file the corresponding criminal complaint.

He said that a year before the pandemic caused by COVID-19, blood samples from suspected cases of hantavirus [infection] were sent to be analyzed at the Malbrán Institute in Buenos Aires. The results took between 3 and 6 days.

Now, the suspected cases are isolated and the samples are analyzed in the molecular biology laboratory that was established some time ago by the Ramón Carrillo de Bariloche hospital. ""PCR determinations can be made for hantaviruses or IGM and have a diagnosis in 24 hours,"" he stated.

He pointed out that in this case it was a previously healthy young patient who was admitted to the sanatorium with symptoms of respiratory failure. For this reason, she immediately required mechanical respiratory assistance but she evolved unfavorably.

Avoid the presence of rodents in your house and their contact with food and water. For this, adopt these precautions:
- Frequently clean floors, tables, drawers and cupboards with 1 part bleach and 9 parts water. Let it act for 30 minutes.
- Eliminate cardboard boxes, papers , firewood or unused articles that could serve as refuges for rodents.
- Keep garbage in metal or hard plastic recipients with good fitting tops.
- Place screens in doorways and windows. 
- Seal openings with metal screens, cement or [other] resistant materials. 
- Clean and disinfect water tanks every 6 months.

[Cases of hantavirus infections occur sporadically in the Andean region of Argentina. In the above report, the case was in severe condition, on mechanical ventilation with hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome and died. 

Hantavirus infections occur in a broad Andean region of Argentina, sporadically including Rio Negro province. Although not specified in this or previous reports from affected regions, the hantavirus involved in this case no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in western Argentina. The patients likely came into contact with areas inhabited by the rodent reservoir of the virus in the region, which is why the health authorities issued warnings about avoiding contact with infected rodents or their excrement.

Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly from person to person and only through close physical contact, usually within the family. This is why contacts are warned about possible risk of infection and placed in isolation. The most common source of the infection is the long-tailed pygmy rice rat.

An outbreak of sheep pox has been detected in the Katon-Karagai region in eastern Kazakhstan, BaigeNews.kz reports with reference to Khabar 24.

According to official figures, about 200 heads of small ruminants are infected. Specialists of the veterinary service note that the disease is not dangerous for humans. Now in the villages of the region they are preparing to declare a quarantine and start vaccinating animals.

Veterinarians say that all small ruminants will have to be vaccinated -- this is about 5000 heads of sheep. In parallel, disinfection and investigation of the causes of the disease will begin.

""In the territory of the Katon-Karagai district, sheep pox has not been registered over the past 50-60 years.

Students have been warned to look out for signs of a deadly bug after an outbreak was discovered at a Scots college. Bosses at the City of Glasgow College have urged students to watch for symptoms of a potentially deadly meningococcal infection after cases were reported.

Meningococcal infections are often severe and can even be deadly. They include infections of the lining of the brain, spinal cord and bloodstream. It can cause meningitis or sepsis, which can lead to tissue damage and organ failure. These types of infections can affect anyone but are most common in babies, young children, teenagers and young adults.

Cases have appeared at the college in the heart of Glasgow's city centre; however, it is currently unclear exactly how many cases there are. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC) are working closely with the college and those who have contracted the infection.

College bosses have written to those enrolled in the campus about the outbreak and to advise on what to do if they develop symptoms.

An email, sent on behalf of John Gribben, HR Executive Director to students, read: ""We are working closely with Public Health Protection Unit (PHPU) and NHSGGC following confirmation that a very small number of students at the College have contracted a meningococcal infection which can cause meningitis or sepsis. The bacteria, which cause this illness, are not easily passed from person to person and PHPU has already contacted all close contacts of these cases and have provided appropriate advice. ""All information available to date suggests there is no evidence of on-site transmission.""
 
They should look out for a high temperature, headaches, stiffness around the neck, drowsiness, unresponsiveness or seizures. They may also develop a rash, begin throwing up, or develop a dislike of bright lights.

A student, who did not want to be named, told the Scottish Sun that everyone has been left shocked by the outbreak. A college spokesperson added: ""We continue to collaborate with PHPU and have already shared their relevant guidance with our students and staff. This advice includes symptoms, what to do if you are displaying any symptoms, and who to contact should you have any concerns for you, a friend or a family member.""
 
NHSGGC also told the Scottish Sun that they want to reassure the college community and the general public that the risk to others remains low. A spokesperson for NHSGGC said: ""We are supporting students and staff following a small number of cases of meningococcal disease connected to the City of Glasgow College. Appropriate public health measures for these cases and their close contacts have been completed.

""NHSGGC continue to work with the college and Public Health Scotland to investigate if there are any links between these cases and if necessary to implement any additional actions following from those investigations. We wish to reassure the college community and the general public that the risk to others remains low. To learn more about the signs and symptoms, or if there are any concerns around meningococcal disease, please visit NHS inform for further information.""

[The news article above reports that an unspecified ""very small number"" of students at the center-city campus of Glasgow City College developed an invasive meningococcal infection, with ""no evidence of on-site transmission,"" but we are not told exactly what that means, nor are we told of any epidemiological link among cases, over what period of time these cases occurred or the meningococcal serogroup(s) causing this outbreak. More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

Meningococcal meningitis is caused by bacterium _Neisseria meningitidis_, which is spread person to person by sharing respiratory and throat secretions at close and prolonged contact (for example, coughing or kissing). People at increased risk of meningococcal disease include household members and roommates of a patient with invasive meningococcal disease, and anyone with direct contact with the patient's oral secretions, such as a boyfriend or girlfriend. These close contacts should receive antibiotic chemoprophylaxis to eliminate nasopharyngeal carriage of _Neisseria meningitidis_ as soon as possible.

Ciprofloxacin has been an effective single-dose oral chemoprophylaxis agent. However, sporadic isolates of ciprofloxacin-resistant meningococcal disease began to appear in the Americas, Europe, Australia, China, and India. As a result, in 2008, the US CDC recommended ciprofloxacin should no longer be used for chemoprophylaxis of meningococcal disease in communities where ciprofloxacin-resistant strains have been identified (selected US counties in North Dakota and Minnesota). Ceftriaxone and rifampin are alternative agents (<https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5707a2.htm>). Azithromycin is also recommended in communities where ciprofloxacin resistance has been detected (<https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt08-mening.html>).

The CDC meningococcal outbreak guidance can be found at <https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/downloads/meningococcal-outbreak-guidance.pdf>. The relevant portion of the guidance is extracted below:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.3 Outbreak thresholds
-----------------------
""The purpose of declaring an outbreak is to determine when appropriate public health interventions should be considered. In contrast to previous guidance in which a threshold of 3 cases of the same serogroup with an attack rate of more than 10 cases per 100 000 population during a 3-month period was used to define both organization- and community-based outbreaks, the current guidance does not recommend the use of an absolute threshold. However, the following thresholds can be considered as guidance, with considerable flexibility to account for the unique nature of each meningococcal disease outbreak.

""For organizations, 2-3 outbreak-associated cases within a 3-month period is considered to be an outbreak (Box 4 -- see below). In most situations, 2 cases within an organization constitute an outbreak. However, in some situations, such as an outbreak within a large university (for example, one with more than 20 000 undergraduate students) where no identifiable subgroup at risk within the population can be identified, it may be reasonable to declare an outbreak after 3 cases.

""For communities, an outbreak is defined as multiple outbreak-associated cases with an incidence of meningococcal disease that is above the expected incidence in a community during a 3-month period (Box 4). Several strategies may be considered to determine whether incidence is above expected in a community. For instance, incidence during the current 3-month period can be compared with the incidence during a similar time period in previous years, or in the setting of very low or unstable monthly incidence, annual incidence in the 3-5 years prior. If community incidence has historically been very low or zero, comparisons against state or national incidence can be made. Additional supportive evidence of an outbreak should be solicited, such as similarity of the strains by molecular typing and common epidemiologic or social characteristics of cases. Consultation with CDC is encouraged if an outbreak is suspected.

""Box 4. Outbreak thresholds
Thresholds by outbreak type
Organization-based: 2-3 outbreak-associated cases within an organization during a 3-month period.
Community-based: multiple outbreak-associated cases with an incidence of meningococcal disease that is above the expected incidence in a community during a 3-month period.

""Although an absolute outbreak threshold is no longer used, calculating an outbreak attack rate may still be useful in determining the magnitude of an outbreak and comparing against a historical baseline. An outbreak attack rate per 100 000 population is calculated as follows: [(number of outbreak-associated meningococcal disease cases during a 3-month period)/(population at risk)] x 100 000. The epidemiology of the cases should be used to determine the appropriate denominator for attack rate calculations and should include the population of the smallest geographic area that contains the cases and be limited to the sub-populations in which cases were reported (such as among certain age-groups or social networks). For some populations, such as MSM (men who have sex with men), determining the denominator can be very challenging. Results of local or statewide surveys (such as proportion of adult male population that is MSM, proportion of population with HIV) along with census data can be helpful in estimating population sizes.

""Previous versions of the outbreak guidance do not define the term 'cluster' of meningococcal disease, though this term is used informally by public health officials. In this updated guidance, the term cluster can be used to describe a grouping of cases thought to be epidemiologically related that are still under investigation or that do not meet the definition of an outbreak.

9. Vaccination
--------------
9.1 Decision to vaccinate
""Vaccination is the preferred control measure for meningococcal disease outbreaks of all serogroups commonly seen in the United States (B, C, W, and Y). However, many factors should be taken into consideration when determining the need for vaccination. While the number of cases is important, other factors to consider include the population size, ability to define a target group for vaccination, whether ongoing transmission is likely, feasibility of a vaccination campaign, and timing of potential vaccination in relation to cases. In situations where ongoing transmission is unlikely (such as cases limited to household members, roommates, or boyfriend/girlfriend), a vaccination campaign is not necessarily indicated as long as antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis of close contacts is implemented to prevent further transmission.

.................................................sb/ml/rd/ml","Students have been warned to look out for signs of a deadly bug after an outbreak was discovered at a Scots college. Bosses at the City of Glasgow College have urged students to watch for symptoms of a potentially deadly meningococcal infection after cases were reported.Meningococcal infections are often severe and can even be deadly. They include infections of the lining of the brain, spinal cord and bloodstream. It can cause meningitis or sepsis, which can lead to tissue damage and organ failure. These types of infections can affect anyone but are most common in babies, young children, teenagers and young adults.Cases have appeared at the college in the heart of Glasgow's city centre; however, it is currently unclear exactly how many cases there are. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC) are working closely with the college and those who have contracted the infection.College bosses have written to those enrolled in the campus about the outbreak and to advise on what to do if they develop symptoms.An email, sent on behalf of John Gribben, HR Executive Director to students, read: ""We are working closely with Public Health Protection Unit (PHPU) and NHSGGC following confirmation that a very small number of students at the College have contracted a meningococcal infection which can cause meningitis or sepsis. The bacteria, which cause this illness, are not easily passed from person to person and PHPU has already contacted all close contacts of these cases and have provided appropriate advice. ""All information available to date suggests there is no evidence of on-site transmission."" They should look out for a high temperature, headaches, stiffness around the neck, drowsiness, unresponsiveness or seizures. They may also develop a rash, begin throwing up, or develop a dislike of bright lights.A student, who did not want to be named, told the Scottish Sun that everyone has been left shocked by the outbreak. A college spokesperson added: ""We continue to collaborate with PHPU and have already shared their relevant guidance with our students and staff. This advice includes symptoms, what to do if you are displaying any symptoms, and who to contact should you have any concerns for you, a friend or a family member."" NHSGGC also told the Scottish Sun that they want to reassure the college community and the general public that the risk to others remains low. A spokesperson for NHSGGC said: ""We are supporting students and staff following a small number of cases of meningococcal disease connected to the City of Glasgow College. Appropriate public health measures for these cases and their close contacts have been completed.""NHSGGC continue to work with the college and Public Health Scotland to investigate if there are any links between these cases and if necessary to implement any additional actions following from those investigations. We wish to reassure the college community and the general public that the risk to others remains low. To learn more about the signs and symptoms, or if there are any concerns around meningococcal disease, please visit NHS inform for further information.""[Byline: Paige Beresford, Colan Lamont]--Communicated by:ProMED[The news article above reports that an unspecified ""very small number"" of students at the center-city campus of Glasgow City College developed an invasive meningococcal infection, with ""no evidence of on-site transmission,"" but we are not told exactly what that means, nor are we told of any epidemiological link among cases, over what period of time these cases occurred or the meningococcal serogroup(s) causing this outbreak. More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.Meningococcal meningitis is caused by bacterium _Neisseria meningitidis_, which is spread person to person by sharing respiratory and throat secretions at close and prolonged contact (for example, coughing or kissing). People at increased risk of meningococcal disease include household members and roommates of a patient with invasive meningococcal disease, and anyone with direct contact with the patient's oral secretions, such as a boyfriend or girlfriend. These close contacts should receive antibiotic chemoprophylaxis to eliminate nasopharyngeal carriage of _Neisseria meningitidis_ as soon as possible.Ciprofloxacin has been an effective single-dose oral chemoprophylaxis agent. However, sporadic isolates of ciprofloxacin-resistant meningococcal disease began to appear in the Americas, Europe, Australia, China, and India. As a result, in 2008, the US CDC recommended ciprofloxacin should no longer be used for chemoprophylaxis of meningococcal disease in communities where ciprofloxacin-resistant strains have been identified (selected US counties in North Dakota and Minnesota). Ceftriaxone and rifampin are alternative agents (<https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5707a2.htm>). Azithromycin is also recommended in communities where ciprofloxacin resistance has been detected (<https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt08-mening.html>).The CDC meningococcal outbreak guidance can be found at <https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/downloads/meningococcal-outbreak-guidance.pdf>. The relevant portion of the guidance is extracted below:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------8.3 Outbreak thresholds-----------------------""The purpose of declaring an outbreak is to determine when appropriate public health interventions should be considered. In contrast to previous guidance in which a threshold of 3 cases of the same serogroup with an attack rate of more than 10 cases per 100 000 population during a 3-month period was used to define both organization- and community-based outbreaks, the current guidance does not recommend the use of an absolute threshold. However, the following thresholds can be considered as guidance, with considerable flexibility to account for the unique nature of each meningococcal disease outbreak.""For organizations, 2-3 outbreak-associated cases within a 3-month period is considered to be an outbreak (Box 4 -- see below). In most situations, 2 cases within an organization constitute an outbreak. However, in some situations, such as an outbreak within a large university (for example, one with more than 20 000 undergraduate students) where no identifiable subgroup at risk within the population can be identified, it may be reasonable to declare an outbreak after 3 cases.""For communities, an outbreak is defined as multiple outbreak-associated cases with an incidence of meningococcal disease that is above the expected incidence in a community during a 3-month period (Box 4). Several strategies may be considered to determine whether incidence is above expected in a community. For instance, incidence during the current 3-month period can be compared with the incidence during a similar time period in previous years, or in the setting of very low or unstable monthly incidence, annual incidence in the 3-5 years prior. If community incidence has historically been very low or zero, comparisons against state or national incidence can be made. Additional supportive evidence of an outbreak should be solicited, such as similarity of the strains by molecular typing and common epidemiologic or social characteristics of cases. Consultation with CDC is encouraged if an outbreak is suspected.""Box 4. Outbreak thresholdsThresholds by outbreak typeOrganization-based: 2-3 outbreak-associated cases within an organization during a 3-month period.Community-based: multiple outbreak-associated cases with an incidence of meningococcal disease that is above the expected incidence in a community during a 3-month period.""Although an absolute outbreak threshold is no longer used, calculating an outbreak attack rate may still be useful in determining the magnitude of an outbreak and comparing against a historical baseline. An outbreak attack rate per 100 000 population is calculated as follows: [(number of outbreak-associated meningococcal disease cases during a 3-month period)/(population at risk)] x 100 000. The epidemiology of the cases should be used to determine the appropriate denominator for attack rate calculations and should include the population of the smallest geographic area that contains the cases and be limited to the sub-populations in which cases were reported (such as among certain age-groups or social networks). For some populations, such as MSM (men who have sex with men), determining the denominator can be very challenging. Results of local or statewide surveys (such as proportion of adult male population that is MSM, proportion of population with HIV) along with census data can be helpful in estimating population sizes.""Previous versions of the outbreak guidance do not define the term 'cluster' of meningococcal disease, though this term is used informally by public health officials. In this updated guidance, the term cluster can be used to describe a grouping of cases thought to be epidemiologically related that are still under investigation or that do not meet the definition of an outbreak.9. Vaccination--------------9.1 Decision to vaccinate""Vaccination is the preferred control measure for meningococcal disease outbreaks of all serogroups commonly seen in the United States (B, C, W, and Y). However, many factors should be taken into consideration when determining the need for vaccination. While the number of cases is important, other factors to consider include the population size, ability to define a target group for vaccination, whether ongoing transmission is likely, feasibility of a vaccination campaign, and timing of potential vaccination in relation to cases. In situations where ongoing transmission is unlikely (such as cases limited to household members, roommates, or boyfriend/girlfriend), a vaccination campaign is not necessarily indicated as long as antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis of close contacts is implemented to prevent further transmission.""The guidance above suggests thresholds for considering vaccination, but decisions to vaccinate should be made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with the local/state health department and CDC taking into account all circumstances and epidemiology specific to the outbreak."" - Mod.MLProMED map:Scotland, United Kingdom: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8708888,280>]",The Scottish Sun,,

[1. The comment about ""FMD symptoms observed in a cattle newly taken to the farm in the village"" is in need of clarification. Is there available information about the origin of the introduced animals? A farm, herd or animal market within Turkey, or transboundary route? Tuzluca is situated 6 km (3.7 mi) from the Aras River, separating Turkey from Armenia; 80 km (~50 mi) from the Iranian border; 310 km (~193 mi) from the Iraqi border (Erbil governorate); and about 400 km (~249 mi) from Gogjaly in Iraq's Mosul governorate, reported by Iraq on 26 Jan 2023 as the site of its primary outbreak of FMD SAT-2, which had started on 3 Jan 2023 (map at <https://tinyurl.com/3wr67cvs>).

2. The above immediate notification (IN) describes a single outbreak. A media report presenting Turkey's Ministry of Agriculture announcement, published on 9 Mar 2023, included the following cited text: ""provincial and district livestock markets are closed down until further notice due to foot-and-mouth disease seen in animals throughout Turkey. All animal markets are now closed due to foot-and-mouth disease in various provinces."" Also: ""all measures, including quarantine, have been taken in 8 enterprises with FMD"" (see ProMED post 20230310.8708855).

On 11 Mar 2023, Anka News Agency (Istanbul) informed that the provinces Samsun, Denizli, Diyarbakır, and Siirt have also closed their animal markets and forbidden the introduction and exit of cattle and small ruminants.

A follow-up report (FUR) is expected to clarify the discrepancy between the information on one outbreak in Igdir, presented in the IN, and the Ministry's alarming information, indicating a wide spread of FMD SAT-2 in Turkey. - Mod.AS]

A foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) alarm has been issued in Turkey. After the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry announced that the 1st case carrying the SAT-2 serotype FMD was detected, the news started to come one after another.

In Tunceli, it was reported that the entrance and exit of animals to the city were prohibited within the scope of FMD measures. In the statement made by the Provincial Directorate of Agriculture and Forestry, it was stated that the ""SAT-2 strain"" of the FMD virus spread rapidly throughout the country. In this context, it was stated that various measures were taken: ""In our province, animal movements in and out of the province (except for slaughter, import and export) are prohibited until further notice.""

In Afyonkarahisar, while animal shipments in and out of the province were stopped, it was reported that the teams of the Provincial Directorate of Agriculture and Forestry and the district directorates will vaccinate cattle and small ruminants [sheep and goats] against FMD. While only animals that will go to the slaughterhouse are allowed to be shipped, it was warned that those who do not comply with the prohibitions will be fined 46 159 TL (USD 2432).

After the 1st case of FMD was detected, 8 enterprises were quarantined. In the statement made by the Ministry [of Agriculture], the following was included: ""Upon the emergence of developments related to FMD in Iraq, within the framework of the Sample Sending and Testing Protocol under the coordination of the European Union Commission for Combating Foot and Mouth Disease (EuFMD), samples from different locations were sent to our FMD Institute Directorate, under our Ministry, for examination.

""Our institute determined that a sample included FMD virus serotype SAT-2, which had not been found in our country before. The virus was isolated, and studies were immediately started for the production of a vaccine against this serotype in our country. All stakeholders, as well as our Provincial Directorates, were warned about the issue. In order to prevent the spread of the disease to our country, our Ministry immediately contacted the relevant institutions and provided the necessary information on increasing border surveillance and road control activities. As a result of meticulous work in the field, the 1st case with SAT-2 serotype FMD has been identified.

""All measures, including cordon-quarantine, have been taken in 8 enterprises that are currently infected. On 8 Mar 2023, the necessary notification was made to the World Animal Health Organization [WOAH; item 1 above]. As a result of the studies carried out by our Institute Directorate, a vaccine against the SAT-2 serotype was produced and become ready for use as of 9 Mar 2023.

""All measures to prevent the spread of the disease were taken by the National Center for Disease Control, which convened upon these developments, and all animal movements (in and out of the province) susceptible to FMD were stopped throughout the country during the spring FMD vaccination campaign, except for the dispatches made for slaughter, import and export purposes. All developments regarding FMD, serotype SAT-2 are closely followed by our Ministry from the 1st moment and all necessary precautions are being taken. Our Ministry, which has completed the production of vaccine against this serotype, which is seen for the 1st time in our country, is rapidly carrying out the necessary studies to vaccinate our entire cattle stock.""

[The official WOAH report mentions a village in Tuzluca as the only site currently affected. Two additional provinces are mentioned in the above media report: Tunceli, situated more than 400 km (~249 mi) west of Igdir, and Afyonkarahisar, often shortened to Afyon Province, within the Aegean region in western Turkey, nearly 700 km (~435 mi) west of Tunceli and 1000 km (~621 mi) west of Igdir. In both, severe preventive control measures have been reportedly undertaken, but no information on actual disease is included. Such epidemiological information is essential. In case the virus already circulates in Afyon, this reflects a long-distance leap of the virus westward, threatening further spread to Thrace.

A province map of Turkey is available at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Turkey>.

According to Iraq's immediate notification of 26 Jan 2023 to WOAH about its primary FMD outbreak in the Ninawa governorate, which had started on 3 Jan 2023, pathological samples ""were sent to Sap Institute/Turkiye"" (ProMED post 20230128.8708022). Receiving these samples during an early stage of the event may have helped the Turkish laboratory to initiate the preparation of a master seed virus and rapidly move to the production of the 1st vaccine batch.

The European Commission for the Control of Foot-and-Mouth Disease (EuFMD), one of FAO's oldest Commissions, inaugurated in 1954, has played a significant role in reducing the risk of FMD in Europe and beyond. Maintaining the buffer zone in Eastern Thrace has been one of its 1st achievements. The EU has not had an outbreak of FMD case since 2011. It's hoped the vaccine produced in Turkey from the current strain passes its safety and efficacy tests successfully, presents high immunogenicity and becomes available regionally. - Mod.AS

In the statement made by the Ministry [of Agriculture], the following was included: ""Upon the emergence of developments related to FMD in Iraq, within the framework of the Sample Sending and Testing Protocol under the coordination of the European Union Commission for Combating Foot and Mouth Disease (EuFMD), samples from different locations were sent to our FMD Institute Directorate, under our Ministry, for examination.""Our institute determined that a sample included FMD virus serotype SAT-2, which had not been found in our country before. The virus was isolated, and studies were immediately started for the production of a vaccine against this serotype in our country. All stakeholders, as well as our Provincial Directorates, were warned about the issue. In order to prevent the spread of the disease to our country, our Ministry immediately contacted the relevant institutions and provided the necessary information on increasing border surveillance and road control activities. As a result of meticulous work in the field, the 1st case with SAT-2 serotype FMD has been identified.""All measures, including cordon-quarantine, have been taken in 8 enterprises that are currently infected. On 8 Mar 2023, the necessary notification was made to the World Animal Health Organization [WOAH; item 1 above]. As a result of the studies carried out by our Institute Directorate, a vaccine against the SAT-2 serotype was produced and become ready for use as of 9 Mar 2023.""All measures to prevent the spread of the disease were taken by the National Center for Disease Control, which convened upon these developments, and all animal movements (in and out of the province) susceptible to FMD were stopped throughout the country during the spring FMD vaccination campaign, except for the dispatches made for slaughter, import and export purposes. All developments regarding FMD, serotype SAT-2 are closely followed by our Ministry from the 1st moment and all necessary precautions are being taken. Our Ministry, which has completed the production of vaccine against this serotype, which is seen for the 1st time in our country, is rapidly carrying out the necessary studies to vaccinate our entire cattle stock.""--Communicated by:ProMED[The official WOAH report mentions a village in Tuzluca as the only site currently affected. Two additional provinces are mentioned in the above media report: Tunceli, situated more than 400 km (~249 mi) west of Igdir, and Afyonkarahisar, often shortened to Afyon Province, within the Aegean region in western Turkey, nearly 700 km (~435 mi) west of Tunceli and 1000 km (~621 mi) west of Igdir. In both, severe preventive control measures have been reportedly undertaken, but no information on actual disease is included. Such epidemiological information is essential. In case the virus already circulates in Afyon, this reflects a long-distance leap of the virus westward, threatening further spread to Thrace.A province map of Turkey is available at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Turkey>.According to Iraq's immediate notification of 26 Jan 2023 to WOAH about its primary FMD outbreak in the Ninawa governorate, which had started on 3 Jan 2023, pathological samples ""were sent to Sap Institute/Turkiye"" (ProMED post 20230128.8708022). Receiving these samples during an early stage of the event may have helped the Turkish laboratory to initiate the preparation of a master seed virus and rapidly move to the production of the 1st vaccine batch.The European Commission for the Control of Foot-and-Mouth Disease (EuFMD), one of FAO's oldest Commissions, inaugurated in 1954, has played a significant role in reducing the risk of FMD in Europe and beyond. Maintaining the buffer zone in Eastern Thrace has been one of its 1st achievements. The EU has not had an outbreak of FMD case since 2011. It's hoped the vaccine produced in Turkey from the current strain passes its safety and efficacy tests successfully, presents high immunogenicity and becomes available regionally. - Mod.ASProMED map:Turkey: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8708881,87>]","WOAH-WAHIS (World Animal Health Information System) 2023, Turkey Posts English",,

[2] Pakistan: Use of art trucks
Date: Thu 9 Mar 2023
Source: Anadolu Agency [edited]
<https://www.aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific/pakistan-uses-famous-truck-art-to-ramp-up-anti-polio-efforts/2840963>


Pakistan is using its famous truck art to ramp up an ongoing countrywide anti-polio campaign aimed at achieving a long-desired polio-free status for the South Asian nuclear nation.

Being one of the best cultural exports in recent years, the truck art has hit the galleries from North America to Europe, prompting stores to sell miniatures. Elaborate and flamboyant designs, blended with cultural, sports, and political themes, have long been an essential part of goods transport, mainly trucks, which run from the southern port city of Karachi to the faraway northwestern Afghanistan border, and to the northern Gilgit-Baltistan region near China's frontiers.

[HM], a truck owner from South Waziristan tribal district, once a hotbed of militancy, has recently repainted the rear side of his vehicle with an anti-polio theme. And he has a reason for it. ""Most of the polio cases are reported in our region, where a large number of parents still resist (anti-polio) vaccination to their children,"" Mehsud said.

Waziristan is considered the poliovirus epicenter, with 16 cases reported among children last year [2022] out of a total of 20 in Pakistan, one of 2 countries, the other being Afghanistan, where the crippling disease still exists.

Despite consistent efforts by the government and non-governmental organizations, many parents, particularly in areas dominated by the ethnic Pashtun population, refuse to have their children vaccinated on faux religious grounds, causing the South Asian nation to continuously miss the mark of a polio-free country.

""The previous painting (on his truck) was about the mountains and the beauty of my hometown. Now I realize that the actual beauty should be a polio-free Waziristan,"" he went on to say. ""I am proud to be a part of the efforts aimed at eradicating polio from the country,"" [HM], a father of 4, said.

Anti-polio messages in local languages, including Pashto, have been painted on trucks traveling on different routes in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, the hub of virus transmission, and Afghanistan, to educate the population.

Most of the truck drivers and owners in Pakistan belong to the ethnic Pashtun community. ""We are registering more trucks to carry this message,"" said Idrees Hayat Baloch, an executive committee member of the Karachi Goods Carriers Association, which is coordinating the campaign.

He told Anadolu that the trucks are carrying the anti-polio message ""from mountains to deserts,"" focusing people in remote areas where it is desperately needed. ""Truck owners' and drivers' response is very encouraging. They are happy to have their trucks painted with the anti-polio theme rather than pictures of singers, actresses, or political leaders,"" Baloch said. ""This is a simple but very effective method of delivering a message to every nook and corner of the country,"" he added.

The primary objective of using truck art, according to Zulfiqar Babakhel, a spokesperson for the National Emergency Operations Center for Polio Eradication, is to spread anti-polio and pro-vaccination awareness across the country, especially in remote areas by using different themes. ""These trucks travel to every nook and corner of the country, especially in areas where some people are still skeptical about the vaccine,"" he told Anadolu.

Pakistan remains under a polio-linked travel restriction imposed by the World Health Organization (WHO). The UN health agency made it mandatory in 2014 for all those traveling from Pakistan to carry a polio vaccination certificate. The ban has been extended every 6 months.

So far this year [2023], the country has not reported even a single case, Babakhel said, adding that the last case was reported last September [2022]. However, according to the WHO standards, a country needs to be without a single case for 3 consecutive years to be declared polio-free.

Last year [2022], the country reported 20 polio cases, including 16 in North Waziristan alone, compared to 1 in 2021, 84 in 2020, and 179 in 2019.

The country has seen a surge in armed attacks on polio vaccinators, mainly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, coinciding with the Taliban's recapture of Kabul in Afghanistan in August 2021. Some militant groups frequently target vaccinators, particularly in border areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and southwestern Balochistan province. They see anti-polio campaigns as part of an elaborate anti-Muslim, Western conspiracy and often issue death threats to vaccinators, many of whom are women, for administrating the vital vaccines to children.

A common misconception is that the vaccine is part of a plot to sterilize Muslim children, especially in rural Pakistan. According to media reports, over 150 people associated with the drive, including security personnel, have been killed in Pakistan since Dec. 2012.

In many areas, Muslim religious scholars in the country dedicate a portion of their Friday sermons to emphasizing the importance of the polio vaccine.

[In last week's update (Poliomyelitis update (10): Israel, RFI, Pakistan, cVDPV1 & 2 AFP & ES 20230305.8708745) there was a media report citing 62 000 children were not vaccinated during the campaigns. The use of the truck art is a novel idea and may help get the messages out, but there is still a sizeable movement against the vaccination as seen in the refusals as well as the violence against polio vaccination workers -- vaccinators and the police guarding the teas.

[3] USA (NY): Travel alert for those going to countries with cVDPVs
Date: Fri 10 Mar 2023
Source: New York State Department of Health press release [edited]
<https://www.health.ny.gov/press/releases/2023/2023-03-10_immunized_against_polio.htm>


The New York State Department of Health today [10 Mar 2023] urged all New Yorkers planning travel this spring to Israel and other countries with circulating poliovirus to get fully immunized against polio and to follow CDC recommendations for such travel.

In recent days, Israel's Ministry of Health confirmed 4 children had tested positive for poliovirus in Northern Israel, after one unvaccinated child presented symptoms of paralysis. The other 3 children are currently asymptomatic. Israel has additionally reported widespread detection of poliovirus in wastewater systems. This latest outbreak follows one that was detected in February 2022 when 7 children tested positive for poliovirus in Jerusalem, 6 of whom were asymptomatic, and after which Israel launched a nationwide vaccination campaign to prevent further spread of the virus. With the latest case, New York health officials have been in contact with their Israeli counterparts to ensure a coordinated response.

Polio is a highly contagious, life-threatening disease that affects the nervous system and can cause muscle weakness, paralysis, and even death. It is spreads from person to person through contact with the fecal matter of an infected person, which is why thorough handwashing is encouraged for anyone who may come in contact with infected persons.

Since a paralytic case of polio in New York State was identified by the state's Wadsworth Center in an unvaccinated adult from Rockland County in July 2022, the New York State Department of Health has been closely monitoring for the paralytic polio virus in New York State. The Department immediately mounted a robust response, working with CDC and local health departments to enhance clinical surveillance, expand wastewater surveillance, and launch immunization efforts in the affected counties. To date, no additional cases of the paralytic polio virus have been identified in New York State.

The CDC currently recommends enhanced precautions for travelers visiting a host of countries with circulating polio, including the United Kingdom, Ukraine, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Indonesia, Nigeria, Côte d'Ivoire, and several other central African countries, as well as Israel (<https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/alert/global-polio>).

The surest way to avoid illness is to be immunized with safe and effective polio vaccines. However, it is important to note that not everyone who is unvaccinated and infected with polio will show symptoms. Some have mild or flu-like symptoms that can be easily mistaken for another type of virus, and others have no symptoms at all. Still, all infected people can spread the virus and infect others, even without symptoms. The best way individuals can ensure they are protected from polio is by making sure they are up to date with polio immunizations. Polio immunization is safe, effective, and the most fundamental protection individuals can keep themselves and their children healthy and safe.

New Yorkers can learn more about polio immunization at <https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/polio/vaccine.htm> and find the latest wastewater surveillance results at <https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/polio/wastewater.htm>. [Of note, the most recent positive wastewater specimen was collected in Orange County in December 2022. - Mod.MPP]

.................................................sb/mpp/rd/ml","The New York State Department of Health today [10 Mar 2023] urged all New Yorkers planning travel this spring to Israel and other countries with circulating poliovirus to get fully immunized against polio and to follow CDC recommendations for such travel.In recent days, Israel's Ministry of Health confirmed 4 children had tested positive for poliovirus in Northern Israel, after one unvaccinated child presented symptoms of paralysis. The other 3 children are currently asymptomatic. Israel has additionally reported widespread detection of poliovirus in wastewater systems. This latest outbreak follows one that was detected in February 2022 when 7 children tested positive for poliovirus in Jerusalem, 6 of whom were asymptomatic, and after which Israel launched a nationwide vaccination campaign to prevent further spread of the virus. With the latest case, New York health officials have been in contact with their Israeli counterparts to ensure a coordinated response.Polio is a highly contagious, life-threatening disease that affects the nervous system and can cause muscle weakness, paralysis, and even death. It is spreads from person to person through contact with the fecal matter of an infected person, which is why thorough handwashing is encouraged for anyone who may come in contact with infected persons.Since a paralytic case of polio in New York State was identified by the state's Wadsworth Center in an unvaccinated adult from Rockland County in July 2022, the New York State Department of Health has been closely monitoring for the paralytic polio virus in New York State. The Department immediately mounted a robust response, working with CDC and local health departments to enhance clinical surveillance, expand wastewater surveillance, and launch immunization efforts in the affected counties. To date, no additional cases of the paralytic polio virus have been identified in New York State.The CDC currently recommends enhanced precautions for travelers visiting a host of countries with circulating polio, including the United Kingdom, Ukraine, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Indonesia, Nigeria, Côte d'Ivoire, and several other central African countries, as well as Israel (<https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/alert/global-polio>).The surest way to avoid illness is to be immunized with safe and effective polio vaccines. However, it is important to note that not everyone who is unvaccinated and infected with polio will show symptoms. Some have mild or flu-like symptoms that can be easily mistaken for another type of virus, and others have no symptoms at all. Still, all infected people can spread the virus and infect others, even without symptoms. The best way individuals can ensure they are protected from polio is by making sure they are up to date with polio immunizations. Polio immunization is safe, effective, and the most fundamental protection individuals can keep themselves and their children healthy and safe.New Yorkers can learn more about polio immunization at <https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/polio/vaccine.htm> and find the latest wastewater surveillance results at <https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/polio/wastewater.htm>. [Of note, the most recent positive wastewater specimen was collected in Orange County in December 2022. - Mod.MPP]--Communicated by:ProMED[This announcement/alert is not surprising given the transmission of the cVDPVs among the affected subset of the Israeli population and the subset of related populations in New York. But it also extends to all countries with cVDPVs. - Mod.MPP]","New York State Department of Health press release, Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI)/World Health Organization (WHO), Anadolu Agency",,

Hundreds of Ruby Princess cruise ship passengers who fell ill on a recent voyage were likely infected with norovirus, according to the cruise ship operator. The CDC, which has been investigating the outbreak on the Ruby Princess, has not confirmed a cause. However, Carnival-owned Princess Cruises, which operates the ship, told FOX Business in a statement ""there [were] a number of cases of mild gastrointestinal illness among passengers"" and that ""the cause likely is the common but contagious virus called norovirus.""

Over 280 passengers and 34 crew members fell ill on the ship. In total, there were 2881 passengers and 1159 crew members. The ship left Texas 26 Feb 2023 for a voyage to the western Caribbean, according to the CDC. The agency also reported that vomiting and diarrhea were the predominant symptoms.

""At the 1st sign of an increase in the numbers of passengers reporting to the medical center with gastrointestinal illness, we immediately initiated additional enhanced sanitization procedures to interrupt the person-to-person spread of this virus,"" Princess Cruises said in a statement. The cruise line said its sanitation program includes measures such as thorough disinfection of high-touch surfaces, encouraging passengers to use correct hand-washing procedures and isolating ill passengers in cabins until they are non-contagious.

When the ship returned to Texas 5 Mar 2023, it ""underwent an additional disinfection"" before its next voyage as an added precaution, the company said. It is on a 7-day western Caribbean cruise and is slated to return to Texas 12 Mar 2023.

[With the return of the cruise industry post-COVID-19, more outbreaks such as this one are likely to occur. Although not confirmed, norovirus is likely to be the cause. In addition to direct testing for norovirus and other pathogens, looking at the epidemiologic curve (case numbers by day of onset of symptoms) and looking at food diaries are useful tools in foodborne outbreaks. Norovirus can be spread by food or water as well as person-to-person. - Mod.LL

[The above report from the US Embassy indicates that there are no new Marburg virus infections in Equatorial Guinea. This is the 2nd US Embassy report indicating that no new cases of Marburg virus infection have been found (see Marburg virus disease - Equatorial Guinea (02): (KN) health alert 20230222.8708530), suggesting that this outbreak has ended. However, the above report goes on to state that as testing increases in the coming days, it is possible that the number of identified existing cases will also increase. Announcements of any new confirmed cases will come directly from MINSABS, and the US Embassy will share this information via alerts.

The above report is an illustration that valuable in-country health-related information is sometimes available from the US Embassy and may be a worthwhile source to check on before travel to that country.

[A] meningococcal case at a Christchurch hall of residence highlights low awareness of free vaccination. The media release from Meningitis Foundation Aotearoa New Zealand says meningococcal B and ACWY vaccines must be made available to all young people.

The organization [Meningitis Foundation Aotearoa New Zealand] is urging all eligible people -- particularly those living in halls of residence in their 1st year of tertiary study -- to seek vaccination for both meningococcal B and the ACWY strains of the disease.

On 1 Mar 2023, Pharmac began funding the meningococcal B vaccine (Bexsero) for all children up to 12 months of age (with a relevant catch-up programme), and for people aged 13 to 25 years who are entering into or in their 1st year of specified close-living situations (with a limited catch-up programme). [Pharmac or Pharmaceutical Management Agency is a New Zealand Crown entity that decides which medicines and pharmaceutical products are subsidised for use in the community and public hospitals (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmac>)].

The criteria are the same as those for existing meningococcal ACWY vaccine, which is also free to eligible groups.

The Meningitis Foundation's chair, Gerard Rushton, says it is the 3rd such case of meningococcal [disease] in Canterbury this year [2023], and follows on the back of a 71.5% rise in cases in 2022 (compared with the previous year). He says that the government must move quickly on 2 fronts, firstly to drive uptake, and secondly to widen access.

""Firstly, we must move quickly to drive uptake of vaccines for both the ACWY strains, and for meningococcal B. It is an imperative that we protect our rangatahi [teenagers or young adults],"" says Gerard. Gerard says the Meningitis Foundation urges all university students in their 1st year living in a hall of residence to get their free vaccinations for all strains of meningococcal disease.

[There are several funded meningococcal vaccines available in New Zealand: a vaccine that covers only serogroup B meningococci, a conjugated serogroup C vaccine, and a tetravalent conjugated vaccine that covers serogroups A, C, W and Y, but not B.

In December 2022, Pharmac announced funding for meningococcal B vaccine (Bexsero) starting on 1 Mar 2023 to protect against meningococcal disease in children up to 12 months of age, administered as part of the childhood immunization program at 3, 5, and 12 months (<https://pharmac.govt.nz/news-and-resources/consultations-and-decisions/2022-12-08-meningococcal-b-vaccine-notification/>).

Veterinary officials in the area have said 3 people have been admitted at a clinic in Biita district [Masvingo Province] after consuming meat from cattle suspected to have died of anthrax. The trio, all members of the same family, were admitted at Murwira Clinic in Ward 22 of Bikita West.

Veterinary officials said the district appeared to have fallen prey to both anthrax and January disease [theileriosis], with Ward 26 worst affected by the outbreak. They warned villagers against consuming meat from animals that succumbed to the 2 diseases and encouraged them to report any outbreak promptly.

Vaccines and drugs to treat cattle were expected, but veterinary officials urged villagers to religiously dip their animals in the meantime.

[Although numbers are not given it would appear that multiple cattle deaths have occurred not just in Ward 22 but in many other areas in Bikita District.

Following multiple anthrax outbreaks in 2020 with over 70 human cases some 44 000 cattle were expected to have been vaccinated. Interestingly at that time cattle deaths had continued in spite of vaccination, indicating that bovine theileriosis (""January disease"") was a matter of concern then. We do not know whether annual anthrax vaccination was implicated in the affected wards but an absence of outbreaks since 2020, 3 years + or -, has been beneficial and needs to be renewed in Bikita and Gutu districts. Repeated vaccination over 7 or 8 years can result in the eradication of anthrax, so it is a worthwhile investment. One is reminded of the need for annual vaccination by the appearance of sporadic cases where procrastination occurs. The Public Health department needs to remind people not to eat meat from animals that have died but just from cattle that have been slaughtered in supervised situations. This is very important.

Theileriosis, or January Disease, is caused by a parasite (_Theileria parva_) found in the blood which is transmitted between cattle by ticks. Theileriosis is one of several tick-borne diseases that occur in Zimbabwe. The hallmark in the control of theileriosis, like all other tick-borne diseases, is to control the tick vector. Unfortunately it is common throughout Masvingo Province. It too is controlled by annual routines, this time with the appropriate pesticides, and traditionally it was cattle dipping.

Virginia health officials said 3 people in Hampton Roads have died from an outbreak of meningococcal disease. ""The deaths occurred between one to 6 days after symptoms began for the 3 fatal cases,"" according to a release from the Virginia Department of Health.

""This strain [_Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup Y] is also believed to be circulating more widely, both in Virginia and other states."" Officials declared the outbreak last September [2022]. A dozen cases have been reported since last June [2022].

Health officials said they have not identified a common risk factor, but most of the patients are Black or African Americans, between 30 and 60 years old.

Symptoms can first appear flu-like and may quickly become more severe. Early detection and diagnosis are essential for timely treatment with antibiotics.

Ensure adolescents and teenagers receive the meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) on schedule at 11 or 12 years old and then a booster dose at 16 years old.

The Virginia Department of Health (VDH) is providing an update for public awareness about the community outbreak of meningococcal disease that continues to spread in eastern Virginia. 12 cases of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) [serogroup] Y have been reported since June 2022; the outbreak was declared in September 2022. Sadly, 3 patients have died from complications associated with the disease, indicating this outbreak strain might cause more severe illness than is usually seen in type Y cases. The deaths occurred between one to six days after symptoms began for the three fatal cases. This strain is also believed to be circulating more widely, both in Virginia and other states.

VDH has not identified a common risk factor; it is thought that the cases are connected by asymptomatic community transmission. Case patients are all residents of Hampton Roads and most are Black or African American adults between 30-60 years of age. 11 patients were not vaccinated for meningococcal disease type Y, and one was partially vaccinated.

Teenagers should receive their 1st dose of MenACWY vaccine prior to entering 7th grade, and a booster dose before 12th grade. If you are part of a group that is considered high-risk for meningococcal disease, including people living with HIV, those whose spleen is damaged or removed, people with sickle cell disease, anyone with a rare immune condition called ""complement deficiency"" or anyone taking a type of drug called a ""complement inhibitor,"" you should talk to your healthcare provider to make sure you are up to date on the MenACWY vaccine.

Contact your local health department if you have questions about your options for accessing the MenACWY vaccine. For additional help contacting your local health department, call 877-VAX-IN-VA (877-829-4682, TTY users call 7-1-1). Assistance is available in English, Spanish, and more than 100 other languages.

The latest information is available on the VDH meningococcal disease outbreak response website (<https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/surveillance-and-investigation/meningococcal-disease-outbreak-response/>).

[The US CDC recommends that all 11 to 12-year-olds should get a MenACWY vaccine, with a booster dose at 16 years old. Teens and young adults (16 through 23 years old) also may get a MenB vaccine (<https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mening/public/index.html>).

CDC also recommends meningococcal vaccination MenACWY (2 months to 10 years of age, and adults) and B vaccines (10 y or older), who are at increased risk for meningococcal disease (<https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mening/index.html>):
- Have a rare type of immune disorder called complement component deficiency
- Are taking a type of medicine called a complement inhibitor (for example, Soliris (R) or Ultomiris (R))
- Have a damaged spleen or sickle cell disease, or their spleen has been removed
- Have HIV
- Are traveling to or residing in countries in which serogroup A, C, W, or Y meningococcal disease is common (MenACWY)
- Are part of a population identified to be at increased risk because of a meningococcal disease outbreak (<https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mening/public/index.html>)

Adults are also recommended to be vaccinated if they:
- Are a microbiologist who is routinely exposed to _Neisseria meningitidis_
- Are not up to date with these vaccines and are a 1st-year college student living in a residence hall
- Are a military recruit

The Wyoming Game and Fish Department, in collaboration with the Wyoming State Veterinary Laboratory, is investigating a rare disease outbreak in pronghorn in western Wyoming.

Game and Fish is estimating that approximately 200 animals have died since mid-February [2023], centered around the southern end of the Mesa south of Pinedale. Preliminary lab results identify _Mycoplasma bovis_ as the pathogen causing the mortalities.

_M. bovis_ should not be confused with _Mycobacterium bovis_ which causes tuberculosis in cattle. They are 2 unrelated bacteria that cause very different diseases.

The source of infection of the _M. bovis_ and the ability to predict the duration and the geographic distribution of this outbreak in pronghorn is unknown at this time.

""While reported _M. bovis_ outbreaks causing mortality in wildlife are rare, this is not the 1st occurrence of _M. bovis_ being linked to pronghorn mortalities in Wyoming,"" said Wyoming Game and Fish Wildlife Disease Specialist Hank Edwards.

The 1st reported cases of pneumonia in pronghorn occurred during the winters of 2019 and 2020 near Gillette, involving at least 460 animals. Those outbreaks started at a similar time in mid-February and then tapered down by the beginning of April.

Game and Fish continues to monitor for this disease across the state. With the exception of the Gillette area, this bacterium has not been reported to be associated with significant mortality in other wildlife populations in Wyoming.

To date, this pathogen has not been shown to affect domestic pets such as horses, dogs, or cats and is not considered a human health risk. Local Game and Fish personnel will periodically remove carcasses and euthanize dying pronghorn in relatively accessible areas when disturbance to other healthy wintering pronghorn is minimal to help reduce the prevalence of this pathogen on the landscape.

<https://www.kmuw.org/agriculture/2023-03-06/theres-a-dangerous-new-tick-in-town-and-its-already-killing-cows-across-several-u-s-states>


Since the Asian longhorned tick [_Haemaphysalis longicornis_] was first discovered in the United States in New Jersey in 2017, it's been detected in more than a dozen states and migrated as far west as Kansas.

A big concern is that the tick is the primary vector for theileria, a disease that causes severe anemia in cows that eventually leads to death. And as the tick has carved a path westward, so has theileria. Cattle in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky and Kansas have tested positive for the disease.

When a case was first detected in a herd in Tennessee in July of last year [2022], the state veterinarian issued a statement to warn cattle producers that the threat of theileria was growing. ""We know it's already taken hold in several other Tennessee counties and will continue to spread,"" Samantha Beaty [Tennessee state veterinarian] said at the time.

Then, in August [2022], the Kentucky Department of Agriculture announced 2 cases in unassociated herds. State veterinarian Katie Flynn said Kentucky is working with producers to learn the clinical signs of theileria so that they can protect their herds. Those signs can be difficult to distinguish because symptoms of theileria are easily confused with another disease common to cattle called anaplasmosis.

Both diseases affect the red blood cells, causing cows to become anemic and lethargic. Theileria and anaplasmosis share symptoms like ""pale mucous membranes and rapid respirations and pulse rates,"" Flynn said.

When producers submit samples from sick cows that test negative for anaplasmosis, Flynn said the state recommends testing for theileria. She hopes that kind of surveillance testing can help catch new cases before they spread.

There is no approved treatment for the disease in the United States, so the most effective method of protection is educating cattle producers on tick control, Flynn said. ""Because most of the animals that we see, by the time they are confirmed positive, they're euthanized or have died due to the severity of the condition,"" she said.

Part of the reason theileria is so devastating to cattle is because it's new to the United States, said Cassandra Olds, a microbiologist at Kansas State University who studies the relationships between pathogens and hosts.

US cows are naïve to the disease, Olds explained, meaning the animals have never been exposed to the pathogen. Without prior experience, their immune systems have no knowledge of how to contend with the disease.

""Outbreaks are always going to be the most severe when something is introduced to an environment,"" Olds said. And at this point, only a statistically negligible portion of the US cattle population has been infected with theileria. But those numbers will continue to grow, along with the list of states in which the disease has been detected.

""It's eventually going to spread. You can't keep it away 100%,"" said Teresa Steckler, a commercial agriculture researcher with the University of Illinois Extension who specializes in the beef industry. ""I figure in southern Illinois, it's a matter of 1.5 to 2 years before we have it,"" she said.

And because younger pregnant cows seem to be the most susceptible to the disease, Steckler said it could have ""potentially devastating effects"" on herd numbers. ""Because if you're losing pregnant females, you know, you're losing the calf as well as that female,"" she said.

While Steckler doesn't expect theileria's effect on the beef supply would be as catastrophic, it would be measurable. ""If this were to really take hold and spread like wildfire, we would see increased prices.""

[The following information is from The University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture (<https://vetmed.tennessee.edu/theileria-orientalis-ikeda-in-tennessee/>):

""_Theileria orientalis_ is a tickborne protozoon infecting red and white blood cells and causing bovine infectious anemia. Clinical signs of theileriosis are similar to anaplasmosis in cattle and include anemia, jaundice, and weakness. Native genotypes of _T. orientalis_ in the United States are usually nonpathogenic; however, _Theileria orientalis_ genotype Ikeda is a virulent strain novel to US cattle. _T. orientalis_ Ikeda infections have been reported to cause mortality in up to 5% of infected cattle. Pregnant heifers and calves are particularly susceptible to the infection. Additional factors, such as breed or age, may increase disease susceptibility in cattle. Clinical findings include weakness, reluctance to walk, and abortion. Physical examination may reveal pale mucus membranes, high fever, and elevated heart and respiratory rates. Cattle that recover from _Theileria_ infections usually become carriers, which is a source of infection for other cattle in the herd.

""Transmission: This is a blood-borne disease, so cattle are thought to become infected within 3 weeks of being placed on pasture containing infected tick vectors. Disease is seen more frequently when naive animals are introduced into an endemic area or when infected animals are introduced to a herd where a competent vector is present. _Theileria_ sporozoites (the infective stage) are transmitted to susceptible animals during tick feeding through the tick's saliva, or through needles that have been used on an infected animal, then a naive animal. The incubation period is about 10-14 days after a tick feeds, and if environmental temperatures are high, infective sporozoites can develop in ticks on the ground (off host) and may enter the host within hours of tick attachment. Ticks can remain infected on a pasture for up to 2 years under favorable conditions.

""Treatment: There is not an approved effective treatment or vaccine for _T. orientalis_. Because of this, prevention and biosecurity are imperative.

""Prevention and control: Regularly inspect cattle for ticks. The ALT (Asian longhorned tick) is small and may go unnoticed with only a quick look. Focus on the head and the neck, but also check the flanks and back, the armpits and groin, and under the tail. Tick larvae, nymphs, and adults may all be found at the same time on a single animal. Cattle with low weight gain, are lethargic or anemic, have patchy hair, or generally look unthrifty should always be inspected for ticks. Animals may have large numbers of ALT, but only a few ALTs may be sufficient to transmit cattle disease. Submit tick samples to your local Extension agent or veterinarian for species confirmation. Once ALT is confirmed on your animals, you should assume it is established in the area and that management for this tick will be a continuing process.

""Chemical control: There appears to be an elevated risk of cattle disease transmission by ALT in February-March and August-September. Tick control is highly recommended during these time periods, but ALTs are active during much of the year. Consider chemical control for ALT from March into November.
- A single pesticide application method may not be fully effective against ALT. Consider using pesticide-impregnated ear-tags along with backrubbers and other devices.
- Ear tags: Use permethrin or organophosphate ear tags. However, ear tags will not be effective in areas that the tick prefers. Do not mix classes of chemicals with insect control. Use the same class of chemicals for 1-2 years, then rotate.
- Use backrubbers and siderubbers (""bullets"") or similar devices charged with permethrin. Hang rubs in such a way that cattle must contact the rub as they move past, spreading the pesticide along the top of their bodies. Vertical strips hung from a backrubber help apply material to the head and flanks as the cattle move past.
- Recharge devices regularly following the pesticide label. ALT management may require recharging devices every 2-3 weeks.
- Pour-ons: Use permethrin at the rate recommended on the label. Apply along the topline of the animal in a narrow strip; start at the back of the withers and continue all the way to the tail head. Be aware that heavy rain may wash pesticides off the animal. Increased fly burdens at several days after a heavy rain may indicate the need to retreat the animal.
- Treat all animals in a herd for ticks at the same time. Apply formulations specifically labeled for tick control. Follow all label recommendations for all pesticides (including ear tags, backrubbers, pour-ons, etc.) used, including time to retreat, withdrawal periods, beef vs dairy, lactating vs dry, use of personal protection, etc.
- Chemical treatment of pastures is not recommended except when tick populations are extremely large. Carbaryl (Sevin) labeled for use on pastures should be restricted to sections of the pasture with the highest number of ticks. Pasture treatments should be used in conjunction with other treatments.
- Chemical control greatly reduces tick burdens on animals but does not eliminate the chance of ticks, tick bites, or acquiring tick-borne diseases.

""Herd management: Inspect purchased cattle for ticks and treat if found before adding to the established herd.
- Consider having animals tested by a vet for tickborne disease if ticks are found on them, especially if the cattle are not gaining weight, have patchy hair, appear lethargic, or show signs of anemia.
- Keep pastures mowed short as long grass and brush enhance ALT survival. Leaving pastures ungrazed will not control ticks as they can survive about a year without feeding. Wildlife in the ungrazed pastures will support tick survival in the absence of cattle too.
- Mow pastures short before rotating stock back into them, even if the cattle have been treated for ticks.
- Keep cattle out of wooded areas. If possible, fence cattle 20 feet away from wooded areas.
- Wildlife, such as deer, small mammals, and birds, can serve as alternative hosts for ticks and assist their spread.
- Check pets if any ticks are found on cattle.
- People working in areas infested with ticks of any species should inspect themselves regularly for ticks.

""It is important that movement of this tick is documented to prevent disease. Dr. Rebecca Trout-Fryxell is a University of Tennessee entomologist who is extremely helpful in monitoring the movement of this tick in Tennessee. She has distributed tick collection kits to local county Extension agents for collection and submission of ticks to keep track of the movement of ALT. If you find ticks on your cattle, contact your local Extension agent or veterinarian so the tick can be submitted to our entomology department for identification.

Remember to check yourself for ticks. They can easily crawl up your boots or jeans to the waistline of pants and burrow in. Be sure to check your neck and ears, as these ticks can easily be missed but will feed from humans. Ticks can pass a variety of ailments to humans. - Mod.TG

.................................................sb/ty/tg/ml/rd/ml","Since the Asian longhorned tick [_Haemaphysalis longicornis_] was first discovered in the United States in New Jersey in 2017, it's been detected in more than a dozen states and migrated as far west as Kansas.A big concern is that the tick is the primary vector for theileria, a disease that causes severe anemia in cows that eventually leads to death. And as the tick has carved a path westward, so has theileria. Cattle in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky and Kansas have tested positive for the disease.When a case was first detected in a herd in Tennessee in July of last year [2022], the state veterinarian issued a statement to warn cattle producers that the threat of theileria was growing. ""We know it's already taken hold in several other Tennessee counties and will continue to spread,"" Samantha Beaty [Tennessee state veterinarian] said at the time.Then, in August [2022], the Kentucky Department of Agriculture announced 2 cases in unassociated herds. State veterinarian Katie Flynn said Kentucky is working with producers to learn the clinical signs of theileria so that they can protect their herds. Those signs can be difficult to distinguish because symptoms of theileria are easily confused with another disease common to cattle called anaplasmosis.Both diseases affect the red blood cells, causing cows to become anemic and lethargic. Theileria and anaplasmosis share symptoms like ""pale mucous membranes and rapid respirations and pulse rates,"" Flynn said.When producers submit samples from sick cows that test negative for anaplasmosis, Flynn said the state recommends testing for theileria. She hopes that kind of surveillance testing can help catch new cases before they spread.There is no approved treatment for the disease in the United States, so the most effective method of protection is educating cattle producers on tick control, Flynn said. ""Because most of the animals that we see, by the time they are confirmed positive, they're euthanized or have died due to the severity of the condition,"" she said.Part of the reason theileria is so devastating to cattle is because it's new to the United States, said Cassandra Olds, a microbiologist at Kansas State University who studies the relationships between pathogens and hosts.US cows are naïve to the disease, Olds explained, meaning the animals have never been exposed to the pathogen. Without prior experience, their immune systems have no knowledge of how to contend with the disease.""Outbreaks are always going to be the most severe when something is introduced to an environment,"" Olds said. And at this point, only a statistically negligible portion of the US cattle population has been infected with theileria. But those numbers will continue to grow, along with the list of states in which the disease has been detected.""It's eventually going to spread. You can't keep it away 100%,"" said Teresa Steckler, a commercial agriculture researcher with the University of Illinois Extension who specializes in the beef industry. ""I figure in southern Illinois, it's a matter of 1.5 to 2 years before we have it,"" she said.And because younger pregnant cows seem to be the most susceptible to the disease, Steckler said it could have ""potentially devastating effects"" on herd numbers. ""Because if you're losing pregnant females, you know, you're losing the calf as well as that female,"" she said.While Steckler doesn't expect theileria's effect on the beef supply would be as catastrophic, it would be measurable. ""If this were to really take hold and spread like wildfire, we would see increased prices.""[Byline: Sarah Nardi]--Communicated by:ProMED from HealthMap Alerts[The following information is from The University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture (<https://vetmed.tennessee.edu/theileria-orientalis-ikeda-in-tennessee/>):""_Theileria orientalis_ is a tickborne protozoon infecting red and white blood cells and causing bovine infectious anemia. Clinical signs of theileriosis are similar to anaplasmosis in cattle and include anemia, jaundice, and weakness. Native genotypes of _T. orientalis_ in the United States are usually nonpathogenic; however, _Theileria orientalis_ genotype Ikeda is a virulent strain novel to US cattle. _T. orientalis_ Ikeda infections have been reported to cause mortality in up to 5% of infected cattle. Pregnant heifers and calves are particularly susceptible to the infection. Additional factors, such as breed or age, may increase disease susceptibility in cattle. Clinical findings include weakness, reluctance to walk, and abortion. Physical examination may reveal pale mucus membranes, high fever, and elevated heart and respiratory rates. Cattle that recover from _Theileria_ infections usually become carriers, which is a source of infection for other cattle in the herd.""Transmission: This is a blood-borne disease, so cattle are thought to become infected within 3 weeks of being placed on pasture containing infected tick vectors. Disease is seen more frequently when naive animals are introduced into an endemic area or when infected animals are introduced to a herd where a competent vector is present. _Theileria_ sporozoites (the infective stage) are transmitted to susceptible animals during tick feeding through the tick's saliva, or through needles that have been used on an infected animal, then a naive animal. The incubation period is about 10-14 days after a tick feeds, and if environmental temperatures are high, infective sporozoites can develop in ticks on the ground (off host) and may enter the host within hours of tick attachment. Ticks can remain infected on a pasture for up to 2 years under favorable conditions.""Treatment: There is not an approved effective treatment or vaccine for _T. orientalis_. Because of this, prevention and biosecurity are imperative.""Prevention and control: Regularly inspect cattle for ticks. The ALT (Asian longhorned tick) is small and may go unnoticed with only a quick look. Focus on the head and the neck, but also check the flanks and back, the armpits and groin, and under the tail. Tick larvae, nymphs, and adults may all be found at the same time on a single animal. Cattle with low weight gain, are lethargic or anemic, have patchy hair, or generally look unthrifty should always be inspected for ticks. Animals may have large numbers of ALT, but only a few ALTs may be sufficient to transmit cattle disease. Submit tick samples to your local Extension agent or veterinarian for species confirmation. Once ALT is confirmed on your animals, you should assume it is established in the area and that management for this tick will be a continuing process.""Chemical control: There appears to be an elevated risk of cattle disease transmission by ALT in February-March and August-September. Tick control is highly recommended during these time periods, but ALTs are active during much of the year. Consider chemical control for ALT from March into November.- A single pesticide application method may not be fully effective against ALT. Consider using pesticide-impregnated ear-tags along with backrubbers and other devices.- Ear tags: Use permethrin or organophosphate ear tags. However, ear tags will not be effective in areas that the tick prefers. Do not mix classes of chemicals with insect control. Use the same class of chemicals for 1-2 years, then rotate.- Use backrubbers and siderubbers (""bullets"") or similar devices charged with permethrin. Hang rubs in such a way that cattle must contact the rub as they move past, spreading the pesticide along the top of their bodies. Vertical strips hung from a backrubber help apply material to the head and flanks as the cattle move past.- Recharge devices regularly following the pesticide label. ALT management may require recharging devices every 2-3 weeks.- Pour-ons: Use permethrin at the rate recommended on the label. Apply along the topline of the animal in a narrow strip; start at the back of the withers and continue all the way to the tail head. Be aware that heavy rain may wash pesticides off the animal. Increased fly burdens at several days after a heavy rain may indicate the need to retreat the animal.- Treat all animals in a herd for ticks at the same time. Apply formulations specifically labeled for tick control. Follow all label recommendations for all pesticides (including ear tags, backrubbers, pour-ons, etc.) used, including time to retreat, withdrawal periods, beef vs dairy, lactating vs dry, use of personal protection, etc.- Chemical treatment of pastures is not recommended except when tick populations are extremely large. Carbaryl (Sevin) labeled for use on pastures should be restricted to sections of the pasture with the highest number of ticks. Pasture treatments should be used in conjunction with other treatments.- Chemical control greatly reduces tick burdens on animals but does not eliminate the chance of ticks, tick bites, or acquiring tick-borne diseases.""Herd management: Inspect purchased cattle for ticks and treat if found before adding to the established herd.- Consider having animals tested by a vet for tickborne disease if ticks are found on them, especially if the cattle are not gaining weight, have patchy hair, appear lethargic, or show signs of anemia.- Keep pastures mowed short as long grass and brush enhance ALT survival.

[1] Taiwan: Mpox vaccination to 3000 people
Date: Wed 8 Mar 2023

The 1st batch of mpox vaccination would be offered to about 3000 people in targeted groups in the 6 special municipalities, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said yesterday [7 Mar 2023], as it reported Taipei's 1st local case of the disease formerly known as monkeypox.

CDC Epidemic Intelligence Center Director Guo Hung-wei said the new mpox case is a man in his 30s who did not travel abroad recently. He developed a fever late last month [February 2023], as well as rashes and blisters on his limbs and torso.

A doctor reported the case for mpox testing and the test result was positive on Friday [3 Mar 2023], he said. The man has been hospitalized for treatment, while 18 close contacts have been identified and asked to monitor their health for 21 days, Guo added.

CDC Deputy Director-General Philip Lo said 2 of the close contacts live with the man, so they would be assessed for receiving a vaccine as post-exposure prophylaxis.

The new case marks the 3rd local mpox infection reported in a week. Lo said that as the 3 cases are not linked to each other, the risk of local infections has increased, so the center plans to offer vaccines to about 3000 people in high-risk groups in the 6 special municipalities in the 1st phase of vaccination.

There are about 1100 doses of mpox vaccine available, with each dose enough to vaccinate about 3 or 4 people, he said. The center would ask the special municipalities' local health departments to coordinate with hospitals to open special vaccination clinics, arrange vaccination training and begin administering the vaccines this month [March 2023].

Recipients would include laboratory staff working with mpox, people who have had any type of sexual contact with a confirmed case and did not receive post-exposure prophylaxis, and people who engaged in high-risk sexual behavior in the past 6 months, such as people with multiple partners, sex workers and their clients, and people who have sexually transmitted diseases.

Lo said the center is procuring about 10 000 doses of mpox vaccines, which are expected to arrive before the Tomb Sweeping Day holiday on 5 Apr 2023 and would be ready to be administered next month [April 2023].

In related news, Guo said 6 new cases of severe influenza complications and 2 flu-related deaths were confirmed last week. Five of the severe cases had influenza A (H3N2) strain and one the influenza A (H1N1) strain. While 5 of them had underlying health conditions, none had been vaccinated this flu season, he said. The deceased had the influenza A (H3N2) strain, were not vaccinated and had underlying health conditions, he added. Daily caseloads seem to be decreasing this week, he added.

[The start of this vaccination campaign is a very prompt response to the first 2 locally acquired cases of mpox that were reported last week. As COVID restrictions continue to be lifted in Asia, other countries need to consider increasing access to vaccinations for their citizens, especially those in high-risk groups and in urban settings. - Mod.CS

Summary
------

What is already known about this topic?
During the 2022 multinational outbreak of mpox, transmission occurred primarily through skin-to-skin contact, including through sex. Persons experiencing homelessness have been disproportionately affected by severe mpox.

What is added by this report?
Among 209 surveyed persons accessing homeless services or staying in encampments in San Francisco, California, without self-reported vaccination or reported previous mpox infection during 25 Oct 2022 to 3 Nov 2022, 3 had detectable anti-orthopoxvirus immunoglobulin (Ig) G or IgM, consistent with possible undetected mpox infection.

What are the implications for public health practice?
Possible undetected mpox among persons experiencing homelessness during the 2022 mpox outbreak highlights the need for tailored outreach strategies that ensure interventions such as prevention messaging and vaccination reach persons experiencing homelessness.

[With access to care and effective outreach being an ever-present issue in the United States for marginalized or disenfranchised groups, it comes as no surprise that people experiencing homelessness will have unreported cases of mpox or report an infection after it has cleared. This continues to support that the current case counts are underreporting the number of mpox infections in the United States. Public health officials need to create initiatives to provide vaccinations to these groups, access to testing, and provider education on mpox presentation. - Mod.CS

To the editor:

We report a death due to mpox in a patient in the United States. A 33-year-old man with HIV infection (CD4+ T-cell count, <35 per cubic millimeter) and recently treated syphilis became infected with mpox virus (MPXV) (clade IIb). He received 2 courses of oral tecovirimat (from 6-20 Aug 2022, and from 21 Aug-4 Sep 2022) and died on hospital day 27.

The patient had not received a vaccine for orthopoxvirus and reported no known exposure to persons with mpox. He had a prodrome of fever and chills, followed by skin lesions on the face, mouth, trunk, arms, legs, genitals, and perianal area that began to appear 4 days later. On day 15 of his illness, mpox was diagnosed; oral tecovirimat was prescribed 6 days later. On day 25 of his illness, he was admitted to the hospital for severe MPXV infection, dehydration, and difficulty with swallowing oral medication. He received intravenous fluids, pain medication, a 2nd course of oral tecovirimat, and broad-spectrum antibiotic agents (see Section S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at <https://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMc2214921/suppl_file/nejmc2214921_appendix.pdf>). He had severe proctitis that led to large-bowel obstruction, sepsis, anasarca, and an exudative pleural effusion on the right side. On hospital day 25, hypoxic respiratory failure, septic shock, and renal failure developed. He was transitioned to comfort care and died on hospital day 27.

An autopsy identified disseminated mpox. Polymerase chain reaction tests of swabs of skin lesions and of tissue specimens of the brain, bone marrow, and testicles were positive for non-variola orthopoxvirus. Histologic examination of a bone marrow specimen revealed evidence of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Histologic specimens did not show evidence of cancer or of other infectious processes.

Whole-genome sequencing of samples obtained during autopsy identified 6 known mutations linked with high-level resistance to tecovirimat in vaccinia virus encoding the VP37 protein. Virus was cultured, and tecovirimat resistance was confirmed by phenotypic testing in 12 of 15 samples. The cause of death was determined to be disseminated mpox.

In hospitalized patients with severe mpox, it is important to consider treatment with intravenous tecovirimat. Second-line therapies including cidofovir, brincidofovir, and vaccinia immune globulin may also be considered. If progressive or persistent lesions are present after 14 days of treatment with tecovirimat, pharmacokinetic testing of tecovirimat and testing of lesion specimens for antiviral resistance are warranted. Patients with low CD4+ T-cell counts who become infected with MPXV should be monitored closely, given the potential risk of more severe illness.

[This case highlights not only the importance of proactive public health intervention to avoid outcomes like these in vulnerable populations, but also it brings attention the importance of multitherapy approaches and close monitoring of immunocompromised patients with severe infection. Furthermore, it brings into question if clinicians should be using viral cultures combined with genomic sequencing at multiple time points in high-risk patients to ensure that treatment will be effective and monitor for the development of resistance. - Mod.CS]

During the 2022 global monkeypox (mpox) outbreak, some patients have experienced severe clinical manifestations. Medical countermeasures (MCMs) developed to treat smallpox have been used to treat mpox.

What is added by this report?
Data relevant to the use of tecovirimat, brincidofovir, cidofovir, trifluridine ophthalmic solution, and vaccinia immune globulin intravenous were reviewed. Animal models, MCM use for human cases of related orthopoxviruses, unpublished data, input from clinician experts, and experience during CDC mpox consultations were also evaluated to develop interim clinical treatment considerations.

What are the implications for public health practice?
Until data from controlled studies are available, these interim clinical considerations facilitate strategic decision-making about the use of MCMs to manage specific severe manifestations of mpox.

[As stated in my previous comment, making sure that providers are made aware of all treatment options is critical for caring for patients with comorbidities. The development of resistance against current treatments will require active and ongoing assessment of resistance markers at presentation and throughout the course of disease to ensure appropriate treatments are used. This will help identify high-risk cases where compassionate use exemptions may be needed for alternate/emerging treatments. - Mods.CS/JH]

In Haiti, as 28 Feb 2023, the Department of Epidemiology, Laboratories, and Research (DELR) has reported 33 661 suspected cases and 2439 confirmed cases in all 10 departments of the country, which represent a 2.61% increase in confirmed cases and a 2.51% increase in suspected cases in the last 7 days. In Haiti, PAHO/WHO continues to support the Ministry of Health (Ministère de la Santé Publique et de la Population [MSPP]) and partners, including in:

- Strengthening coordination of the cholera response in each of the 10 departments by providing surge capacity in epidemiological surveillance, case management, water, hygiene, sanitation, community and risk communication.
- Enhancing epidemiological and laboratory surveillance at the department level to improve the quality of data and reporting, as well as to strengthen the capacity of the regional laboratories for the rapid detection and diagnosis of cholera, including procuring equipment, laboratory materials and reagents.
- Improving case management in cholera treatment centers (CTCs) by supporting health directorates in clinical care, water, hygiene, sanitation and infection prevention and control, including the CTCs established in prisons.
- Distribute medical and non-medical supplies to aid the cholera response in all departments across the country, including Ringer lactate fluids, infusion sets and oral rehydration salts for case management as well as aqua tabs for the purification of water.

In the Dominican Republic, the Ministry of Public Health confirmed 12 new cholera cases since the last report on 17 Feb 2023, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 88, of which 71 are reported in the capital city of Santo Domingo.

Whole of Syria cholera outbreak situation report no. 13
-------------------------------------------------------

Epidemiological overview
------------------------
Between 25 Aug 2022 and 15 Feb 2023, 92 649 suspected cases have been reported from all 14 governorates, including 101 associated deaths to date at a case fatality rate of 0.11%. A total of 8042 new suspected cases have been reported since the last update (SITREP 12) was issued. The most affected governorates to date are Idleb (27 863 cases), Aleppo (22 123 cases), Deir Ez-Zor (20 671 cases), and Raqqa (17 578 cases).

The devastating earthquake had a significant impact on the cholera response operations. The earthquake affected access to services, reduced partner capacity, diverted already limited funds available, and also affected negatively the mental health of the workforce. So far, a total of 171 [health facilities] (54 in Latakia, 48 in Hama, 14 in Aleppo, and 55 in NWS) are reportedly damaged, including at least 7 hospitals, with assessments ongoing. A total of 15 health facilities had to suspend their operations, and 18 health facilities have reduced functionality due to earthquake damage. Thousands of people are currently housed in overcrowded collective shelters, many without adequate access to sufficient safe water, sanitation, and hygiene measures. There is temporary disruption of infectious disease surveillance systems and laboratory capacity across affected areas.

The risk of increase of waterborne diseases including cholera is very high due to overcrowded settings, extensive damage to water and sanitation infrastructure, and damage and disruption to cholera treatment infrastructure.

Description of the outbreak
---------------------------
The 1st case of cholera in the current outbreak was reported to the Ministry of Health and WHO from Lago district in Niassa province on 14 Sep 2022. As of 19 Feb 2023, a cumulative total of 5237 suspected cases and 37 deaths (case fatality rate [CFR] 0.7%) have been reported in 29 districts from 6 of 11 provinces in the country. Of at least 182 cases tested, 99 cases (54%) were laboratory confirmed for cholera due to the identification of _Vibrio cholerae_ type Ogawa by culture. As of 19 Feb 2023, 8 districts (Chimbonila, Lago, Lichinga, Mandimba, Mecanhelas, Muembe, Ngauma and Sanga) of Niassa province (north of the country) reported 2525 cases and 16 deaths (CFR 0.6%). In the central region of the country, 9 districts (Beira, Buzi, Caia, Cheringoma, Chibabava, Gorongoza, Maringue, Marromeu, and Muanza) of Sofala province reported 1354 cases and 3 deaths (CFR 0.2%). A total of 9 districts (Angonia, Cahora Bassa, Chiuta, Doa, Marara, Moatize, Mutarara, Tete, and Tsangano) from Tete province reported 1271 cases with 12 deaths (CFR 0.9%) since December 2022. Zambezia province (Milange district) bordering Malawi reported 14 cases. In the southern region of the country, one district (Xai-Xai) in Gaza province reported 42 cases and 4 deaths (CFR 9.5%). In addition, one district (Tambara) in Manica province reported 34 cases and 2 deaths (CFR 5.9%).

Additionally, 4 districts from 3 provinces (Tete 2, Zambezia 1, and Cabo-Delgado 1) have reported cases of acute watery diarrhea (AWD) that were positive for cholera by rapid diagnostic test (RDT) with culture results pending. Notably, in the past 30 days the districts reporting cholera and AWD are increasing, with 3 new provinces reporting confirmed cholera.

Prior to the current outbreak, there were cholera outbreaks in 8 districts in 3 provinces during the 1st half of 2022, which were declared over. The current outbreak of cholera in Mozambique covers a wider geographic area and has a higher CFR compared with the previous outbreak. Moreover, most of the affected districts, especially in Niassa province, had not reported cholera cases for more than 5 years, and many of the health professionals do not have experience in responding to a cholera outbreak. Weak surveillance with late reporting, inadequate WASH conditions (lack of access to safe drinking water, poor sanitation and hygiene practices), a weak health system and exhausted workforce responding to multiple emergencies pose a threat to continued disease progression, as do the ongoing heavy rains of the season.

WHO risk assessment
-------------------
Cholera is endemic in Mozambique, and cholera outbreaks have been reported in the country every year during the hot and rainy season (October to April), mainly from Nampula, Cabo Delgado, Sofala and Tete provinces. However, the current outbreak has greater geographical extent than outbreaks reported in 2019-2022, when no more than 3 provinces were affected during the year.

The 1st cholera case of the current outbreak was reported from Lago district on 14 Sep 2022, Niassa province, located in the northern region of the country, which shares a border with Malawi and Tanzania. All 6 provinces currently affected by cholera are located in the Zambezia Valley, which is a flood-prone area. As the rainy season continues, it is anticipated that more districts will be affected. The rainy season lasts until March-April, usually with a peak of rainfall recorded in January and early February. Heavy rainfall has already been reported in 7 of 11 provinces in the 1st weeks of February 2023 (31 Jan to 9 Feb 2023), with flooding in Maputo province leading to displacement and disruption of the water supply system. There is inadequate access to safe drinking water sources for the population that is already challenged with poor hygiene and sanitation, and the current rainy season could contribute to sustained disease transmission.

Several affected provinces, such as Niassa, Tete and Zambezia, are bordering Malawi, which is currently facing its deadliest cholera outbreak in history. The borders with Malawi are porous with frequent movement across the border between the 2 countries.

On 26 Jan 2023, Zambia notified WHO of a cholera outbreak in its Eastern province bordering Malawi and Mozambique, where one of the index cases had just returned from Mozambique. There remains a high risk of spread to other countries in the region, including Tanzania and Zimbabwe and further to South Africa. Considering the history of cross-border spread of cholera during this outbreak, the risk of further disease spread is therefore considered very high at the national and regional levels.

WHO advice
----------
A multi-pronged approach is essential to combat cholera and reduce mortality. The measures used combine surveillance, improvement of water supply, sanitation and hygiene, risk communication and community engagement, treatment of the disease and use of oral cholera vaccines. Countries affected by cholera are advised to strengthen disease surveillance and national preparedness to rapidly detect and respond to possible outbreaks.

WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel and trade to and from Mozambique.

[Most cholera outbreaks are related to _V. cholerae_ O1 type Ogawa. There are 3 distinct O1 types -- Ogawa, Inaba, and Hikojima -- each of which may display the ""classical"" or El Tor phenotype (or biotype). The biotypes are distinguished by their expression of surface antigens A, B, and C. Ogawa contains antigens A and B; Inaba contains antigens A and C; and Hikojima contains antigens A, B, and C. The latter serotype is relatively rare. - Mod.LL

Zimbabwe has recorded 5 cholera cases since the dreaded disease was reported in the country early in February [2023], government has said. At a post-cabinet media briefing Tuesday [7 Mar 2023], Information, Communication and Technology Minister Jenfan Muswere said no deaths have been recorded since 12 Feb 2023 when the 1st case was recorded.

""Since 12 Feb 2023, 60 suspected cases of cholera have been reported in Zimbabwe from Chegutu (58), Mudzi (1), and Mutare (1). Of these, 5 cases have been confirmed by culture test, and as of 6 Mar 2023, there has been no reported death from cholera and no patient has been admitted for the disease,"" he said.

Muswere said government was accelerating its surveillance and response mechanisms countrywide in the wake of the high risk posed by diarrheal diseases such as cholera and typhoid, which are common in the rainy season.

""Government is also instituting processes for the refurbishing and upgrading of sewer and reticulation systems and provision of clean water,"" he said, adding that several actions in response to the cholera outbreak have been instituted. These include activation of the national, provincial and district rapid response teams as well as the Civil Protection Committee (CPC) and the National Reference Laboratory, which is carrying out drug sensitivity tests for any suspected cases of cholera while acute water diarrheal (AWD) kits are pre-positioned at cholera hotspots.

Cholera outbreaks are being reported in a number of SADC [Southern African Development Community] countries, including Malawi, Zambia, Mozambique and South Africa, with Malawi being the most affected.

[6] Cholera - Malawi
Date Tue 7 Mar 2023
Source: UNICEF/UN [abridged, edited]
<https://reliefweb.int/report/malawi/geneva-palais-briefing-cholera-outbreak-malawi>


This is a summary of what was said by Rudolf Schwenk, UNICEF Representative in Malawi -- to whom quoted text may be attributed -- at the 7 Mar 2023 press briefing at the Palais des Nations in Geneva.

""Malawi is experiencing the deadliest cholera outbreak in its recorded history. The country is also struggling to respond to a polio outbreak and ongoing COVID-19 cases across the nation. Resources are limited, the health system is overburdened, and health workers are stretched to their limits. These are incredibly difficult times for the children of Malawi.

""Since the outbreak was officially announced just over one year ago, cholera has spread to all 29 districts in the country, affecting more than 50 000 people with over 1500 deaths (as of 2 Mar 2023). Of these, more than 12 000 children have contracted cholera and 197 have died.

The conditions for this lethal cholera outbreak were likely caused by tropical storms Ana and Gombe, which hit Malawi just over a year ago, combined with chronic underfunding on water and sanitation infrastructure, and a disruption of cholera prevention campaigns due to COVID-19. And as this year's [2023] rainy season reaches its peak, UNICEF is extremely concerned that -- without immediate and adequate action -- this outbreak will worsen. Combine this with the ongoing annual lean season -- when millions of Malawians are expected to be food insecure -- and children are suffering most as a result of this crisis. As the planet warms, Malawi is likely to be hit by worse climate-induced hazards such as stronger storms and droughts.

""Today an estimated 4.8 million children, or one in 2 children in the country, are in humanitarian need. By the end of March 2023, almost a quarter of a million children (more than 213 000) under 5 years of age are expected to be acutely malnourished, with over 62 000 expected to be severely malnourished. As a severely malnourished child is 11 times more likely to die from cholera than a well-nourished child, a bout of cholera may amount to a death sentence for thousands of children in Malawi.

""Since the 1st case was reported about a year ago, together with the WHO and other partners, UNICEF has supported the Government of Malawi in controlling transmission and minimizing the fatality rate through the training of response teams at all levels, providing equipment and essential supplies, life-saving drugs, safe water, and disseminating cholera prevention, treatment, and hygiene promotion messages in affected and cholera-prone areas. But we are now short of funds and supplies.""

[7] Cholera - South Africa (Gauteng)
Date: Wed 1 Mar 2023

The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) confirmed on Wednesday [1 Mar 2023] that there are now 6 confirmed cholera cases in South Africa, and one person has died of the disease.

According to the Institute, the first 3 cases can be traced to the current outbreak in Malawi. Two sisters who traveled there came back with cholera, and the husband of one of the sisters was subsequently infected. However, the second 2 cases were locally acquired with no direct links to the first 3 and no travel history to Malawi. A 6th case is under investigation. According to the NICD, the 2 local cholera cases meet the definition of an outbreak. The source of these infections is not presently known.

The NICD warned there was an ongoing risk of cases being imported following travel from other African countries experiencing cholera outbreaks (especially Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe). Detecting locally acquired cases is critical to guide public health investigations and timely interventions that effectively interrupt cholera transmission in affected communities.

""Healthcare workers and laboratories countrywide have been urged to consider and test for cholera in persons with acute watery diarrhoea,"" their statement continued.

Cholera mainly spreads when water is contaminated by human feces; it can also be spread when food is in contact with contaminated water.

While the Gauteng Department of Health has denied that water is the source of the current outbreak, the NICD advises that water should be boiled for a minute or treated with household bleach (one teaspoon of bleach to 20 liters of water). The Gauteng Department of Health issued a statement dismissing social media messages claiming it had warned communities not to drink tap water. ""Water in South Africa is generally safe to drink and cook with when taken from taps. The country's national water quality standard lives up to the World Health Organization-set standards,"" their statement reads.

The head of the NICD's Centre for Enteric Diseases, Dr Juno Thomas, said extreme weather events (droughts and flooding) multiplied the risk of cholera outbreaks. Over the past 2 years, many outbreaks globally followed extreme weather events. ""The risk is particularly high in communities that do not have reliable access to safe water, improved sanitation and hygiene. An important local example was the cholera outbreak of 2008-2009,"" she said.

""However, the initial cases were directly linked to the outbreak in neighboring Zimbabwe, and people were crossing the border to seek healthcare. Shortly afterward, cholera was introduced into rivers and other untreated water systems in Mpumalanga and struck communities that did not have access to safe (treated) water. This resulted in a rapid spread of disease and many thousands of cases,"" said Thomas.

""The 1st step in preventing an outbreak is to have robust public health surveillance and laboratory systems so that cholera cases can be detected rapidly. Next, an immediate public health response is required when cholera cases are detected to investigate the possible source(s) of infection and actively search for other possible cases.

""Further action depends on the scenario (for example, an imported case or a case of infection acquired locally). Throughout this process, community engagement and health education are essential, particularly for vulnerable communities, to provide accurate information about the risks of cholera and how households can protect themselves.

""Awareness of the disease among healthcare professionals is also essential so that the correct tests are done and cases of cholera aren't missed,"" Thomas added.

While some spread can occur in more developed nations, substantial outbreaks do not occur where there are adequate sanitary systems. - Mod. LL

The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has reported that provincial and district livestock markets are closed down until further notice due to foot-and-mouth disease seen in animals throughout Turkey. All animal markets are now closed due to foot and mouth disease [FMD] in various provinces. Intercity animal transport is prohibited. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry announced that all measures, including quarantine, have been taken in 8 enterprises with FMD. After the decision of the Ministry, the producer associations warned their members to implement the decision.

The Turkish Veterinary Medical Association also warned about the risks arising from FMD all over Turkey, especially in the earthquake region.

Turkish Veterinary Medical Association (TVHB) Central Council President Prof. Dr. Murat Arslan pointed out that there are nearly 14 million bovine and ovine animals in the earthquake region and emphasized that vaccination and preventive medicine services against infectious diseases should be continued uninterruptedly.

Arslan requested that containers be provided to the veterinarians whose clinics were destroyed in the earthquake so that the veterinary service would not be disrupted in the region.

He said the supply of vaccines and drugs should also be free for a while.

The following statements were also included in the statement of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry on the subject:

""Due to the developments regarding foot and mouth disease in Iraq, samples from different locations were sent to our Ministry's Foot and Mouth Institute Directorate, within the framework of the Sample Sending and Testing Protocol, under the coordination of the European Union Commission for Combating Foot and Mouth Disease (EuFMD).

Our institute determined that a sample was found to be of serotype SAT-2, which has not been found in our country before. The agent was isolated, and studies were immediately started for the production of a vaccine against this serotype in our country. All stakeholders, as well as our Provincial Directorates, were warned about the issue.

In order to prevent the spread of the disease to our country, our Ministry immediately contacted the relevant institutions and provided necessary information on increasing border surveillance and road control activities.

As a result of meticulous work in the field, the 1st case of FMD serotype SAT-2 was identified. All measures, including cordon-quarantine, have been taken in 8 enterprises that are currently infected. On 8 Mar 2023, the necessary notification was made to the World Organization for Animal Health.

As a result of the studies carried out by our Alum Institute Directorate, a vaccine against the SAT-2 serotype was produced and made ready for use as of 9 Mar 2023.

All measures to prevent the spread of the disease were taken by the National Center for Disease Control, which gathered upon these developments, and all animal movements (in and out of the province) susceptible to FMD were stopped throughout the country during the spring FMD vaccination campaign, except for the dispatches made for slaughter, import and export purposes.

All developments regarding FMDV SAT-2 are closely followed by our Ministry from the 1st moment and all necessary precautions are taken.

Our Ministry, which has completed the production of vaccine against this serotype, which is seen for the 1st time in our country, is rapidly carrying out the necessary studies to vaccinate all of our cattle.""

[FMDV SAT-2 is known to have been circulating in Jordan and Iraq since January 2023. The timeline of the Iraqi event may be of help in the assessment of the chronology and prospects of the evolving event in Turkey. 

1. On 14 Jan 2023, the veterinary hospital in Nineveh informed FMD cases in buffaloes and cows in Nineveh Governorate; samples were sent to the central laboratories in Baghdad for serotyping (archive no 20230116.8707801). The specific location(s) of outbreaks were not named. Nineveh governorate borders Syria's governorate of Al-Hasakah and is 4.5 km distant from Turkey's Silopi district of Şırnak Province. 

2. On 26 Jan 2023, Iraqi authorities notified the WOAH about FMD in the village Gogjaly, Mosul, Ninawa, which had started on 3 Jan 2023. They stated that pathological samples were sent to Sap Institute/Turkiye and that serotyping was ""pending"" (archive no 20230128.8708022). 

3. On 3 Feb 2023 Iraq submitted its 1st follow-up report, notifying 9 new FMD outbreaks throughout the country, of which 3 (in Kalar, Amedi and Arbil districts) were situated in the Kurdistan region. This report informed that samples from cattle and buffalo, collected in Gogjali, were sequenced at the Pirbright Institute and identified as FMDV SAT-2 on 2 Feb 2023 (archive no 20230204.8708168). 

The circulation of the virus in Iraq started, in Mosul and the Kurdistan region, bordering Turkey, the latest in early January 2023. According to Turkey's Agriculture Ministry, early identification of the SAT-2 serotype allowed alerting stakeholders as well as starting, and -- allegedly -- completing the production of a vaccine against this serotype. In view of the virus, probably, already gaining hold of the territory in which it has been circulating for some time, the job on the hands of the Turkish veterinary establishment in controlling it is considerable; the recent FMD event in Indonesia comes to mind. 

On 6 Feb 2023, southern Turkey suffered a devastating earthquake. Though it happened more than 400 km (249 mi) west of the FMD-affected region, this catastrophe may have interfered with Turkey's effort to handle the initial spread of the exotic virus, which threatens the region. 

Hopefully, Syria, Iran and other regional countries may have alerted their own stakeholders and undertaken adequate preventive measures, including enhanced surveillance. - Mod.AS

A total of 638 cases of plague including 14 deaths were recorded in 2022 in Ituri province, in the north-east of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), according to a report by the Epidemiological Surveillance Directorate of the General Directorate for Disease Control of the Ministry of Public Health, Hygiene, and Prevention sent to the ACP on [Mon 6 Mar 2023].

""The main focus of the plague epidemic in Ituri was the health zone of Rethy with 625 cases while 3 other cases were notified in the health zone of Aru"", specifies the report. The mortality rate of the plague, which remains an endemic disease in Ituri, is 2.1%. Ituri is the only province in the DRC to have recorded cases of plague in 2022. From 2020 to 2022, 10 Ituri health zones reported cases of plague. These are Biringi, Rethy, Aru, Aungba, Linga, Logo, Rimba, Kambala, Fataki, and Drodro health zones.

The DRC experienced plague epidemics in 2005 in Banga in the province of Bas-Uélé, in 2006 in Wamba in the province of Haut-Uélé and in Linga and Rethyen Ituri, in 2007 in Rimba in Ituri and in 2014 in Logo and Mahagi in Ituri.

Plague is a bacterial zoonosis caused by _Yersinia pestis_, usually found in small mammals and the fleas that parasitize them. People infected with _Y. pestis_ often show symptoms after an incubation period of 1 to 7 days. There are 2 main clinical forms: bubonic plague and pneumonic plague. The first is the most common and is characterized by painful swelling of the lymph nodes, the ""buboes"".

Plague is transmitted from animals to humans by the bite of infected fleas, by direct contact with infected tissue, and by inhalation of infected respiratory droplets. It can be very serious in humans, with a case fatality rate of 30% to 60% for the bubonic form and it is almost always fatal in its pulmonary form if left untreated. Since antimicrobial treatment is effective against the bacterium that causes plague, early diagnosis, and treatment can save lives.

According to the WHO, from 2010 to 2015, there were 3248 cases of plague worldwide, including 584 fatalities. The 3 main endemic countries currently are Madagascar, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Peru.

Communicated by:
ProMED 

[Most cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea, causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a bubo. Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, other animals, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being bitten.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. Bacteremia can also occur as an initial event. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. The pneumonic form of infection can spread by the airborne route. - Mod.LL

.................................................mo/ll/ao/ml","A total of 638 cases of plague including 14 deaths were recorded in 2022 in Ituri province, in the north-east of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), according to a report by the Epidemiological Surveillance Directorate of the General Directorate for Disease Control of the Ministry of Public Health, Hygiene, and Prevention sent to the ACP on [Mon 6 Mar 2023].""The main focus of the plague epidemic in Ituri was the health zone of Rethy with 625 cases while 3 other cases were notified in the health zone of Aru"", specifies the report. The mortality rate of the plague, which remains an endemic disease in Ituri, is 2.1%. Ituri is the only province in the DRC to have recorded cases of plague in 2022. From 2020 to 2022, 10 Ituri health zones reported cases of plague. These are Biringi, Rethy, Aru, Aungba, Linga, Logo, Rimba, Kambala, Fataki, and Drodro health zones.The DRC experienced plague epidemics in 2005 in Banga in the province of Bas-Uélé, in 2006 in Wamba in the province of Haut-Uélé and in Linga and Rethyen Ituri, in 2007 in Rimba in Ituri and in 2014 in Logo and Mahagi in Ituri.Plague is a bacterial zoonosis caused by _Yersinia pestis_, usually found in small mammals and the fleas that parasitize them. People infected with _Y. pestis_ often show symptoms after an incubation period of 1 to 7 days. There are 2 main clinical forms: bubonic plague and pneumonic plague. The first is the most common and is characterized by painful swelling of the lymph nodes, the ""buboes"".Plague is transmitted from animals to humans by the bite of infected fleas, by direct contact with infected tissue, and by inhalation of infected respiratory droplets. It can be very serious in humans, with a case fatality rate of 30% to 60% for the bubonic form and it is almost always fatal in its pulmonary form if left untreated. Since antimicrobial treatment is effective against the bacterium that causes plague, early diagnosis, and treatment can save lives.According to the WHO, from 2010 to 2015, there were 3248 cases of plague worldwide, including 584 fatalities. The 3 main endemic countries currently are Madagascar, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Peru.--Communicated by:ProMED [Most cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea, causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a bubo. Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, other animals, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being bitten.When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. Bacteremia can also occur as an initial event. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death.

Since [Fri 3 Mar 2023], 9 cases of clinical botulism in Germany can be linked to a history of botulinum neurotoxin injections into the stomach in Turkey in the period from [22 to 25 Feb 2023]. The intention of such a procedure might have been prospective weight reduction. All adult patients (8 women and 1 man) had been in Istanbul and were treated at the same hospital there. Drug potency may be an additional issue. Symptoms are comparable to food-borne botulism. Some patients are in the ICU while milder cases or those with gradually developing symptoms may not (yet) be recognized and hospitalized.

Turkish authorities have been informed and are investigating. Laboratory confirmation in Germany is ongoing but will be challenging when compared to food-borne botulism because of the mode of application and the doses applied.

After decades of botulism surveillance in Germany, these are the first notified cases of botulism associated with medical treatments.

Please see ECDC's next weekly threat report (<https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-and-data/monitoring/weekly-threats-reports>) for additional cases in Europe.

[Injecting the gastric muscles with botulinum toxin A is sometimes used as a relatively minimally invasive weight loss procedure. The injections are done using endoscopy with a flexible tube equipped with a syringe, inserted into the stomach through the mouth.

The medication immobilizes the muscles of the stomach wall for about 3 months, preventing the injected muscles from contracting. This results in the food in the stomach staying longer, slowing digestion and the patient feels fuller faster and for a longer time.

Initially, studies in mice did show desired weight loss but there remains debate on whether the therapy is effective in achieving the weight loss goal. As an example the following non-controlled study, actually from Istanbul, Turkey, in 13 patients did not show positive results.

Abstract
---------
""Background/Aims: The aim of this study is to share the results of gastric botulinum toxin (BTX) application in individuals who are overweight or type 1 obese without comorbidity.

""Materials and Methods: In this study, 13 patients were included who were enrolled for gastric BTX application for the first time. A total of 300 U of BTX-A (Allergan Botox ®1 vial 100 U) was diluted with 8 mL of 0.9% NaCl saline, and antrum (100 U to 8 spots), corpus (100 U to 8 spots), and fundus (100 U to 8 spots) regions were injected intramuscularly. Patients were given a 1200-calorie low-carb diet and this was followed for 6 months.

""Results: Gastric BTX application was applied to 13 patients with a mean age of 40.9 ± 5.2 (85% female), a mean body mass index (BMI) of 28.41 ± 1.4 kg/m2 (26-31.6) and a mean excess weight of 10.1 ± 3.6 kg. As a result of the 6-month follow-up, only 4 patients (30.8%) were able to lose more than 50% of their excess weight (6-15 kg). A total od 6 patients (46.2%) could not lose any weight. There was an average decrease of 3.3 kg in the weight of patients before and after BTX application (P = .03). A mean decrease of BMI was detected, 1.17 kg/m2 (P = .032).

""Conclusion: It was concluded that the application of gastric BTX for weight loss does not provide effective results.""

The following is extracted from the above paper (the citations can be found in the original URL):
""In the literature, there are 3 experimental studies that investigated the effect of BTX [botox] application in the stomach on weight loss and stomach functions. The first one is the study by Gui et al. where they compared the injection of BTX and saline into the gastric antrum in mice. After 10 weeks of follow-up, they detected more weight loss and less food consumption in the BTX group (8). In a similar study conducted in our country, it was found that weight loss was observed for a temporary period and gastric emptying was accelerated in the scintigraphic study (9). A similar study from Korea has recently been published, and a 6-week follow-up revealed significant weight loss in mice treated with BTX compared to the saline group.

""BTX application to stomach in an obese patient was performed for the first time by Rolnikk et al. and it was published as a case study. In this study, 100 U BTX were applied to the pre-pyloric antral wall in a patient with a BMI of 31.4 kg/m2 and a decrease of 8.9% was observed in the total BMI (10). Later, the first clinical study was done by Garcia-Compean et al. In their study, Garcia-Compean et al. applied 100 U BTX to 8 spots in the antrum in 12 obese individuals, and they did not detect any significant difference in terms of weight loss after 8 weeks of follow-up (11). Foschi et al. administered saline to one group of patients and 200 U of BTX was applied to the antrum to another group, and both groups were supported with a 1200-calorie diet. During the follow-up, the BTX group lost an average of 11.2 kg and the saline group lost 5.7 kg (12) of excess weight. In a study by Liu et al., 300 and 100 U BTX were compared and it was detected that 300 U provided more weight loss (13) In another study by Topazian et al. including 60 patients, patients were divided into 4 groups and saline, 100, 300 and 500 U BTX injections were administered using guided ultrasound. After 16 weeks of follow-up, there was no difference in weight loss in the groups (14).

""Two meta-analyses have been published on gastric BTX application. The first, published by Bang et al. in 2015, evaluates 7 studies and BTX application was found to be more effective than placebo (15). The 2nd meta-analysis was published in 2017 and it was concluded that the application of BTX to stomach has no effect on weight loss (16).

""In our study, at the end of the 6-month follow-up after 300 U of BTX application, when the patients were compared according to their weight status, there was an average decrease of 3.3 kg (P = .03). As many as 6 patients could not lose any weight. However, 4 patients were able to lose more than 50% of their excess weight (6-15 kg). The remaining 3 patients were able to lose 25% of their excess weight. When this comparison was made in terms of BMI, after 6 months, a decrease of 1.17 kg/m2 was detected in patients (P = .032).

""Gastric BTX application has recently become one of the frequently used weight loss methods in our country. The reason might be that it is non-invasive and perceived as a completely risk-free weight-loss therapy. In our study, no complications developed in the patients administered BTX. In fact, there were no serious side effects reported in clinical studies either. Only in one case report, total gastric necrosis after BTX application was reported which necessitated total gastrectomy (17). In the report published in 2008 due to various indications for BTX application, the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reported 16 deaths due to respiratory arrest aspiration pneumonia (17,18) From this perspective, gastric BTX should not be seen as a completely risk-free application.

""In our study, only overweight and type 1 obese individuals without comorbidity were included. Morbidly obese individuals were not included. Participants received a single session of BTX application. With repeated BTX applications, no evidence has been obtained as to whether a more effective weight loss can be achieved in this study.""

It remains to be seen how effective this modality is in the short and long term management of obesity. This report appears to document one of the risk factors of therapeutic botulinum toxin injection, that is, the development of clinical botulism. With this ""cluster"" of cases, one would suspect problems with dosing and/or administration technique. We await the upcoming report from ECDC. - Mod.LL

Residents of a neighborhood on the Mercer/Monmouth county border were warned about a rabid stray cat.

The Hamilton Township Animal Shelter and Adoption Center said an ""aggressive"" stray cat that bit a human near Nursery Lane and Aqua Terrace on 21 Feb 2023 tested positive for rabies. The office asked anyone who had contact with the cat to notify them.

According to the state Department of Health, rabies can attack the nervous system and cause death in both animals and humans. In New Jersey, cats account for the vast majority of domestic animal rabies cases.

Rabid animals are usually either vicious and aggressive or may appear to be drunk and have trouble walking. Some animals may be rabid even though they appear to be normal. People should stay away from all wild and stray animals that are aggressive or appear to be sick.

[Rabies is a fatal disease: fatal to animals and, without specific treatment, fatal to humans.

Rabies is preventable in animals. Please have your pets vaccinated against rabies virus. Keeping your pet up to date on their rabies vaccination can build a barrier between you and the deadly disease. Likewise, vaccination can prevent your animal from having to be euthanized.

This is the old adage of an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, but of course there is no cure for rabies, except death. This is true for wild animals and domestic animals, and for humans who are bitten by a rabid animal and do not seek immediate medical treatment. So save a life today! It may be your pet's life you save, or even your own. Therefore, vaccinate your animals.

Vaccines are available for most animals, including dogs, cats, horses, and other livestock including cattle. Don't wait. Rabies vaccination must be given prior to your animal's exposure. - Mod.TG

Municipal Corporation officials in Maharashtra's Thane have warned against feeding pigeons as cases of hypersensitive pneumonia, a lung disease, are on the rise.

The Thane Municipal Corporation or TMC had put up several posters in the city recently to spread public awareness about the disease, which spreads due to pigeon droppings, as bacteria, and mold causes inflammation in the lungs, completely destroying them.

Health experts say that the numbers shoot up in people who live in the vicinity of droppings and feathers accumulating nearby. The breathable antigen arising from the bird droppings and feathers goes into the lung and leads to an immunological reaction, which damages the lung.

The symptoms of hypersensitivity pneumonitis can be acute or chronic. Acute symptoms come on within a few hours of being around an allergen and last a few hours or days. Chronic symptoms on the other hand can develop slowly and get worse over time. A few common signs of the ailment are breathlessness, dry cough, tightness in the chest, chills, fatigue, high fever, muscle pains, chronic cough, and unexpected weight loss.

How can hypersensitive pneumonia be diagnosed? Diagnoses for hypersensitivity pneumonitis can be done based on your symptoms and personal history, physical exam, and a few other tests. A few of these tests include:
- Allergy tests: this is done through blood samples that check if you have signs of a reaction to the allergens.
- Imaging: chest x-rays and CT scans can look for the damage.
- Pulmonary function tests: most lung function tests involve breathing into a tube attached to a machine to measure how well your lungs are working.
- Bronchoscopy: a small, flexible tube that passes through your nose or mouth can view the inside of your lungs and collect samples.

Ways to prevent hypersensitive pneumonia: according to health experts, hypersensitive pneumonia is not reversible, and so it is best to prevent the damage caused by the ailment. Avoiding exposure to allergens that cause lung inflammation to reduce your risk include:
- Wearing masks and personal protection gear if your workplace has a lot of birds and animals around, or there is heavy usage of animals, lumber, paper, grain, etc.
- Keep humidifiers, hot tubs, and heating and cooling systems clean and in good condition.
- Avoid feather-filled bedding. Keep your pets' living spaces clean.

[Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is due to a hypersensitivity reaction in the lung after inhalation of aerosolized particles, 4 to 5 micrometers, which contain the disease-evoking antigens, in susceptible individuals (<https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0035464580&origin=inward&txGid=822c73c2eb87a0758ad54ac2fc2fb5aa>). The resulting lung disease carries various names, such as pigeon breeders' lung, bird fanciers' lung, mushroom-pickers' disease, grain-handler's lung, bagassosis, lumber/paper mill workers' lung, chemical worker's lung and farmers' lung, depending on the type of exposure (<https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/48/3/818>).

In pigeon breeders' lung, patients have flu-like symptoms (chills, fever, cough, myalgia, and dyspnea) when exposed to pigeons and recover with cessation of exposure. However, with repetitive exposure, chronic symptoms of dyspnea and cough may develop, without remission after cessation of exposure.

The diagnosis is made from a combination of clinical features, radiographic abnormalities, lung function tests and immunological tests (e.g., counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIE) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)). Avoidance of the disease-evoking antigen is key the treatment.

<https://kitchener.ctvnews.ca/twelve-cases-of-whooping-cough-cases-identified-in-wellington-dufferin-guelph-1.6302487>


Twelve cases of pertussis -- also known as whooping cough -- have been reported in Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph [Ontario] since the fall [2022] and local public health says that's higher than normal.

In a news release issued Tuesday [7 Mar 2023], Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health (WDGPH) said many individuals may be behind on their vaccinations because of COVID-19 delays.

""Pertussis is serious -- especially for our children,"" Dr Nicola Mercer, medical officer of health for Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph said in the release. ""While we have only seen a few cases so far, it is particularly dangerous for children under one year of age and those who are not fully vaccinated. Infection in these individuals can result in hospitalization or death."" Public Health said now is the time to get fully vaccinated ""as we engage in more community activities."" Vaccination is the best way to prevent whooping cough, the release said. Vaccines are available at public health clinics or doctor's offices.

Whooping cough is a bacterial infection that spreads through droplets that are sprayed when someone sick with the disease sneezes, coughs, or talks. According to public health, it could also be spread by direct contact with objects used by someone sick.

Early symptoms of whooping cough resemble a cold with a runny nose and a cough. ""The cough becomes more frequent and severe,"" WDGPH said. Public Health said that a child may gag, vomit, have trouble breathing, or give a loud ""whoop"" sound when breathing in, but not all infected persons make that sound. If these symptoms develop, experts advise you to contact your healthcare provider as soon as possible.

Syphilis cases are spiking in Marion County [Oregon], with a 216% increase from 2018 to 2022, Marion County Health and Human Services data show. The rise in cases is widespread, according to the health department. It said there was no clear reason for the spike. Officials are encouraging anyone age 45 and younger who has been sexually active to get tested.

""Syphilis rates are rising among men, women, and newborns. Fortunately, syphilis remains 100% preventable and treatable when affected community members have access to healthcare,"" Marion County public health officer Dr Caroline Castillo said.

Syphilis spreads through person-to-person sexual contact, mainly through direct contact with a syphilitic sore, which may not always be easy to see. Some people can have syphilis without even knowing it.

Congenital syphilis cases, which are contracted during pregnancy, are also on the rise. There has been a 235% increase in congenital syphilis nationwide since 2016, preliminary Center for Disease Control data shows. Congenital syphilis can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, illness, and death in newborns.

Marion County has also seen an increase in gonorrhea and chlamydia cases, according to county data.

The county health department provides free sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment at its public clinic at 3180 Center Street NE in Salem. To schedule an appointment, call 503-588-5342. Everyone is eligible for testing at the public clinic, even those without health insurance.

Who is impacted? Anyone who is sexually active can contract syphilis. The only way to fully avoid syphilis or other sexually transmitted infections is to not have sexual contact. The risk of contracting syphilis can be reduced by properly using condoms and getting tested regularly when sexually active.

In Marion County, the highest rate of syphilis is among adults aged 20 to 39. The county is currently seeing more positive cases in white men but emphasized the rise in cases is not isolated to a specific group or demographic.

Positive test ... what next? Syphilis testing is done using a blood test. If the test is positive, it is typically treated with penicillin. Individuals who receive a positive test can receive treatment at the Marion County Health clinic or from their local healthcare provider. Marion County Health can provide bus passes to individuals needing transportation to the clinic, and sometimes it will give gas cards to those with financial barriers. Marion County Health stressed the importance of seeking treatment after testing positive. Untreated Syphilis can cause long-term health problems such as dementia, heart disease, nerve damage, and blindness.

The Ministry of Health of Khartoum state has initiated several interventions, after 2 people suffering from dengue fever died on Wednesday [1 Mar 2023]. In a statement on Friday [3 Mar 2023], the ministry said that the number of confirmed cases of dengue fever has risen to 487, which represents an increase of 30 cases since Wednesday. These figures include 103 patients who are affected by both dengue fever and malaria.

The number of suspected cases has reached 1055, which is 106 more than on Wednesday.

According to the reports, the disease is now prevalent in the densely populated Ombadda and Karari localities in Omdurman, and Khartoum locality.

The Ministry announced interventions to contain the spread of dengue fever, including inspection and home education to reduce breeding sites for mosquitoes inside homes, spraying with machines carried on vehicles, and treatment of cases, as well as activities to raise health awareness.

The cumulative number of dengue cases in Kelantan up to the epidemiological week 8 this year [week of 20 Feb 2023] was up by 41, with 280 recorded compared to 239 during the same period last year [2022].

""However, no death has been recorded so far and one of the contributing factors to the increase in dengue cases is the unpredictable weather,"" said Kelantan state Health Department (JKNK) director Datuk Dr Zaini Hussin

He told reporters this after the Syariah Compliant Nursing Course opening ceremony at Kolej Poly-Tech Mara (KPTM) Kota Bharu today [5 Mar 2023], which was also attended by KPTM Kota Bharu deputy academic president Mohd Sahidi Yaakob.

Elaborating, Dr Zaini said a total of 97 784 premises were inspected and 463 were issued with compound notices, amounting to RM 231 500 [about USD 51 200], under the Destruction of Disease-Bearing Insects Act (APSPP) 1975 (Act 154) for being breeding grounds for _Aedes_ mosquitoes.

The Malaysia Ministry of Health reports 19 450 cumulative dengue fever cases through the 1st 2 months of 2023, an increase of some 212 percent compared to the same period in 2022 (6229).

In 2023 to date, 15 dengue-related fatalities have been reported in Malaysia, compared to 2 deaths same period last year.

Dengue is a disease caused by a virus spread through mosquito bites. The disease can take up to 2 weeks to develop with illness generally lasting less than a week. Health effects from dengue include fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, rash, muscle and joint pain, and minor bleeding.

Dengue can become severe within a few hours. Severe dengue is a medical emergency, usually requiring hospitalization. In severe cases, health effects can include hemorrhage (uncontrolled bleeding), shock (seriously low blood pressure), organ failure, and death.

<https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/atea-dumps-dengue-drug-unevaluable-endpoint-causes-forecast-rd-timelines-costs-spiral>


Clinical data have convinced Atea Pharmaceuticals it cannot make the numbers add up in dengue fever. Based on the results, the antiviral biotech calculates it would take at least 3 years and cost several hundred million dollars to run phase 2 studies, prompting it to put the program on the back burner.

Atea ran 2 small clinical trials of AT-752, a double prodrug of a guanosine nucleotide analog, to assess its potential in the treatment and prevention of dengue. The results precipitated the end of the program.

In the 1st cohort of the treatment trial, investigators randomized 21 dengue-infected patients to receive the oral drug AT-752 or a placebo 3 times a day for 5 days. Atea designed the study to assess change in dengue virus load from baseline. The problem? Some patients already had low or undetectable levels of dengue at baseline. As such, Atea found the primary endpoint was ""unevaluable.""

Atea thinks participants presented too late in the course of the infection to evaluate change in viral load. The clinical trial sought to mitigate that risk by limiting participation to people who had developed a fever in the previous 48 hours, but that inclusion criteria may have failed to have the desired effect.

""Patients sometimes have a hard time identifying when the fever started exactly. And so they probably presented later by the time we were able to enroll them,"" Arantxa Horga, MD, chief medical officer at Atea, explained on a conference call with investors. ""Another factor is that the test that we use for enrollment...is an antigen test. They're not as sensitive as PCR, but sites don't have PCRs available. So, we will need to develop better, more sensitive diagnostic tests.""

Atea's human challenge infection study encountered other problems. The study was designed to test the ability of AT-752 to prevent dengue infection, but results from the 5 healthy volunteers showed high variability in the levels of the virus and antigens as well as in the onset and severity of symptoms. Atea concluded it would need to test the drug candidate in more than 50 people to account for the variability.

The realization that it will take longer and cost more than expected to show whether AT-752 works led Atea to deprioritize the program. Atea, which ended last year [2022] with USD 646.7 million to its name, will focus on drugs against COVID-19 and hepatitis C. The narrowing of focus will extend Atea's runway out to 2026.

There is a chance another organization will step in and take AT-752 forward. Atea CEO Jean-Pierre Sommadossi, PhD, told investors there are nonprofit and government agencies that may be interested in the program, and, while the company isn't giving guidance on if and when a deal may happen, it is interested in discussing potential agreements with 3rd parties.

[The dengue situation in Asia and Africa continues much the same as it ended in 2022, breaking records for cases. Malaysia and Sudan have generated most media reports in the past several weeks so it will be interesting to see if dengue has finally plateaued in other hard-hit areas, or if they too will set monthly records. It is also worth noting that while the vaccine front has been much more promising of late, the difficulties in developing a therapeutic that can be evaluated in the face of endemic/epidemic dengue circulation pose unique challenges. Improvements in diagnostics and screening questions will be critical for therapeutic development to ensure trial enrollees are not already in middle to later stages of infection before initiation of treatment. - Mod.JH]

Adding further panic over the adenovirus spread in West Bengal, the deaths of 3 more children, admitted to 2 hospitals in Kolkata with related symptoms, have been reported during the last 24 hours.

Of the 3 fresh deaths, 2 have been reported from Calcutta Medical College & Hospital and one from BC Roy Children's Hospital. Though the state Health Department has stopped issuing any bulletin on virus-related deaths, there are claims of 48 deaths during the last 11 days.

One of 2 children reported to have died at the Calcutta Medical College & Hospital is [SP] (10 months) of a family residing in Hooghly district. He was referred to the hospital from Imambara Sadar Hospital in Chinsurah in Hooghly.

The 2nd death in the same hospital during the last 24 hours was of [ST] (6 months). He was admitted to the hospital on 26 Feb 2023 with flu-like symptoms.

[SB] (10 months) also passed away in BC Roy Children's Hospital. One of his family members told media persons that he was admitted to the hospital a week back with a severe lung infection, fever, and breathing problems.

A senior state Health Department official said that because of the tendency of referring affected children from the district hospitals, the pressure on Kolkata, especially the BC Roy Children's Hospital is enormous and that is why the maximum number of child deaths during the last few days have been reported from city hospitals.

The department has already issued an advisory for doctors, especially paediatricians, to take special care of children being admitted with flu-like symptoms, especially those aged 2 years or below since they are most vulnerable to being affected by adenovirus. In wake of the alarming situation, the Health Department has cancelled all the leaves of staff for an indefinite period.

Special outdoor units have been opened at state-run hospitals with special paediatric units so that such cases do not have to wait at the general outdoor units.

There are few complications of bone marrow transplantation more dangerous than a viral infection that heads for the lungs.

Jim Boonyaratanakornkit, MD, PhD, aims to do something about it. With a team of researchers at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, he is reporting progress on the development of an experimental drug combination to prevent infection by 4 common respiratory viruses. Before the emergence of COVID-19, these 4 have been blamed for more than half of serious lung infections in patients with compromised immune systems, such as those recovering from transplants.

In experiments described in the journal Nature Communications [see reference below], the team reports how they discovered 2 rare antibodies that, if combined into a ""cocktail,"" can block infection by all 4 of those viruses: respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV; human metapneumovirus, or HMPV; and 2 types of human parainfluenza viruses, HPIV1 and HPIV3.

Respiratory viruses of all kinds are a serious threat for patients recovering from transplants of bone marrow or blood stem cells, while their new immune systems are gaining strength. Boonyaratanakornkit said 1/3 of those patients acquire a respiratory viral infection within 6 months; and in 1/3 of those, the virus progresses to the lower respiratory tract.

""Once the virus gains a foothold in the lower tract, little can be done,"" he said. ""As a result, up to 40% of patients with lower tract disease die within 3 months.""

RSV has been in the news lately because of a US outbreak last fall [2022] that led to a spike in hospitalizations of children in respiratory distress. In addition, a 1st ever vaccine for RSV is nearing US Food and Drug Administration approval for adults over 60. A new drug to prevent RSV in infants and children up to 24 months old is also under FDA review. It could be an improvement over an old standby, palivizumab, in use since 1998.

While these advances may be good news for young children, Fred Hutch's Boonyaratanakornkit said that cancer patients facing transplant have more complex needs because of the threats from multiple viruses.

""The new drugs and vaccines don't translate well into the immune compromised population,"" he said. ""You really need to cover much more ground to make an impact on these patients. The key point of our work is that we wanted to go broad.""

His team's answer is to produce a single drug, an infusion of immune-proteins called antibodies, that can block RSV and the other 3 viral threats at once. Their new paper describes how they came up with it, and although it has been tested only in hamsters so far, it has shown it can block infections by all 4 viruses.

Years more work is needed before a candidate drug can be readied for human clinical trials, and the Fred Hutch team is continuing to study ways to improve on antibodies they discovered and describe in their new paper.

It took some nifty lab detective work to find the 2 rare antibodies used in their formulation.

The ability to block 2 different viruses with one antibody is known as ""cross-reactivity,"" a feature that is critical for giving one drug the capability to deal with multiple viruses.

One antibody, dubbed 3 x 1, is capable of blocking 2 different parainfluenza viruses. A 2nd antibody, which they call MxR, cross-reacts to both respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus (yes, they are a mouthful).

Boonyaratanakorkit's work on this project took off when he and Fred Hutch immunologist Justin Taylor, PhD, began tracking down antibodies that can block parainfluenza.

Despite the name, parainfluenza has nothing to do with the flu. Influenza and parainfluenza viruses may look similar under a microscope, but they are from entirely different viral families. Instead of causing respiratory illness in winter like influenza, parainfluenza causes disease in the other 9 months of the year.

Boonyaratanakornkit and Taylor's 1st success was with HPIV3. Their research focused on finding white blood cells, components of the immune system known as B cells, that produced antibodies that could block that virus. They came up with one that did.

Out of 200 million B-cell rich spleen cells, they fished out 2 rare B cells that were naturally cross reactive. Using laboratory techniques, they were able to generate multiple copies of just one of them. They now could grow a single antibody that could knock down both parainfluenza viruses. They named it 3 x 1.

""We didn't know that a cross-reactive antibody for these existed, but we found one we could use. It was just luck,"" Boonyaratanakornkit said.

With a somewhat similar screening process, they used bits of RSV and HMPV as bait in a pool of 200 million blood cells taken in blood draws. Out of that large pool, they were able to fish out B cells that made an antibody that would cross-react, or bind, to either of those viruses. They now had MxR.

When these rare immune proteins are produced in large numbers through a laboratory process, they are called monoclonal antibodies.

The researchers then made batches of 3 x 1 and MxR monoclonal antibodies and mixed them into a ""cocktail."" It is a single drug meant to be injected, designed to prevent infection by any of the 4 viruses. In tests with hamsters, the experimental drug bound to the viruses and prevented infection.

The Fred Hutch team is attempting to target 4 different viruses with their 2-antibody cocktail, delivered in a single injection. Boonyaratanakorkit said the 4 [viruses] they are targeting do not have a history of rapid genetic mutation, like influenza and SARS-CoV-2.

In future research, Boonyaratanakornkit and colleagues are hoping to genetically engineer their experimental drug so it will last longer in the body. Antibodies lose their potency over time, and longer-lasting versions of these 2 cross-reactive antibodies would hold an advantage.

Eventually, they hope to engineer a so-called ""bi-specific"" antibody, which on a single Y-shaped protein would contain, on the respective left and right arms of the protein, the separate binding sites for MxR and 3 x 1. This is a dream drug -- an infusion containing millions of antibodies of a single design that can efficiently knock out 4 dangerous respiratory viruses. ""We're working on that,"" Boonyaratanakornkit said.

The Australian Grains Research and Development Corporation (GRDC) has issued an alert for a range of cereal diseases, after a ""tsunami"" of diseases had affected cereal crops in the eastern states in 2022 due to excessively wet conditions. The upcoming winter cropping season carries mammoth disease risks from heavy stubble loads and infected seeds. 

Crops and varieties should be chosen carefully and good quality seed used. Timing of fungicide applications and rotating modes of action is also important. Since chickpeas are no longer favoured by farmers in crop rotations, they are encouraged to plant oilseed rape and faba beans rather than wheat after wheat. Volunteer cereals and weeds serving as green bridge for carrying inoculum into this season must be destroyed with herbicides or heavy grazing prior to planting.

Diseases of concern include wheat and barley rusts; crown rot of wheat and durum wheat; white grain; and fusarium head blight (FHB). One registered fungicide is available for FHB, but there is no reliable treatment for crown rot as yet. The major barley diseases in 2022 were powdery mildew and leaf rust. Resistance to powdery mildew has broken down in some of the European varieties with a single resistance gene. Loose smut was an issue in a number of varieties.

New pathotypes are expected to be detected in the next year or so. Exotic incursions of pathogens and their hybrids are making it harder to control leaf rusts and develop varieties resistant against not one, but several genotypes. Pathotypes have been seen to travel extensively within Australia, not just in wet years.

[All diseases mentioned above are caused by or associated with fungi:
- wheat and barley rusts by closely related species and strains of _Puccinia_;
- crown rot of wheat and fusarium head blight of small grain cereals by several species currently or originally classed into the genus _Fusarium_;
- white grain was shown to be associated with _Botryosphaeria zeae_ (ProMED post 20101226.4552), but may also be due to fusarium head blight in other cases;

[Flavescence doree (FD) is one of the most important and destructive diseases of grapevines owing to its fast rate of spread within vineyards. The disease was first reported in 1954 in southern France and has been spreading in southern Europe. FD was thought to have been introduced from the United States, the home of its primary vector. It is caused by a phytoplasma (_Candidatus_ Phytoplasma vitis) belonging to the 16SrV (elm yellows) group.

Symptoms can vary on different grape varieties and usually appear in late spring. They may include shortened internodes, stunting, leaves with downward rolled margins, as well as drooping shoots. Leaves turn yellow in white grape cultivars and red in red ones. Leaf necrosis and bark splitting may also develop; yield is severely reduced. Some vines die, usually in the year following infection. The survivors continue to harbour the pathogen but appear symptomless (latent infections) unless they are re-infected.

FD is spread by the vine leafhopper _Scaphoideus titanus_ and through infected propagation material. Symptomless budwood can carry both eggs of the vector and the pathogen. Reliable diagnosis in both symptomatic and asymptomatic host tissue by molecular methods is vital for disease management, which may include pathogen exclusion, certification of clean propagation material and removal of infected plants (pathogen reservoirs). Insecticides can reduce vector numbers. The phytoplasma may be eliminated by treating dormant canes with hot water (heat therapy).

In Europe, a northward spread of the disease is being observed. The vector was reported to have overcome the Alps in the mid 1990s, followed by the 1st report of FD north of the Alps in 2014 (from Germany; ProMED post 20141217.3038025). The spread of FD in central Europe is considered another example of ""warm climate diseases"" moving into cooler regions due to climate change (see, for example, Esca disease of grapevine, ProMED post 20141024.2895414).

Coffee wilt (tracheomycosis) appeared in Ivory Coast in the 1930s and 1950s, destroying many coffee plantations. At that time, more resistant varieties of coffee were introduced. Now, the disease is back in all coffee-producing areas of the country.

A survey in 2022 showed that of 169 plots visited in parts of Goh-Djiboua district, 14.2% were affected by coffee wilt; in upper Sassandra district, orchard contamination rate is estimated at 50%. Scientists are working to develop techniques so that growers can manage the disease.

[Coffee wilt (CW) disease (also called tracheomycosis) is caused by the fungus _Fusarium xylarioides_ (Fx; previously _Gibberella xylarioides_). A number of strains exist with different host preferences for (1) _Coffea canephora_ (robusta or lowland coffee); (2) _Coffea arabica_(arabica or highland coffee); and (3) other _Coffea_ spp. Of these, the robusta strains are the most aggressive and have caused the worst losses to commercial coffee cultivation.

CW can attack all stages of growth; infected plants show 100% mortality. Symptoms include wilting, defoliation and streaks in the wood; they occur sequentially until all branches are killed. Berries ripen prematurely and dry up. Pathogen spread occurs with infected plant material (firewood, seedlings), contaminated soil or tools, and by wind, water and mechanical means. Although cultural practices have shown some success in disease management, crop varieties with higher levels of CW resistance appear to be the most promising approach. CW-resistant varieties are being developed, but in the past problems were encountered in the region with distributing them to farmers.

Previously, the disease occurred sporadically in Africa, decimating coffee production in the 1920s-1950s. It re-emerged in the 2000s and is now considered a major constraint to African coffee production. Recent research on Fx genetics suggests that different populations arose independently and that Fx can increase its virulence by acquiring genes from related _Fusarium_ species (see links below).

The Swedish National Veterinary Institute (NVI) would like to comment on item [3] Sweden: wild bird, HPAI H5N5 of the posting, as further investigations have shown that the date of detection is incorrect in the report to WOAH (<https://wahis.woah.org/#/in-review/4942>).

On 23 Feb 2023, the NVI received several recently dead birds for avian influenza testing within the national surveillance program. The barnacle goose that tested positive for H5N5 was marked with information that it died on 20 Feb 2023. Upon detection of an unexpected strain (H5N5), the submitter was contacted to confirm the date and location of the finding. He informed the NVI that the goose had died on 20 Feb 2021, not 2023, and had been sent for sampling by mistake.

Thus, this case does not represent a reoccurrence of the H5N5 subtype, which has not been detected in Sweden since May 2021.

The National Director of SERNAPESCA [National Fisheries and Aquaculture Service], Soledad Tapia Almonacid, delivered a new report on the situation of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in marine species in Chile.

""Over the weekend [4-5 Mar 2023] we were notified of a positive result for bird flu by the Agricultural and Livestock Service after the laboratory results tested samples of a marine otter in Arica. This male specimen was stranded dead in the vicinity of the Lluta River wetland near Las Machas beach [Arica and Parinacota region] along with other birds, for which the procedure for suspicion was started with the corresponding sampling conducted jointly 
with the Chilean Secretariat of Agriculture (SAG)"", said Tapia.

This is the 1st specimen of the _Lontra felina_ species officially affected in our country by avian influenza. This is added to the confirmation of a 3rd common sea lion with a positive result, this time in the Tarapacá region. The balance to date indicates that 4 marine mammals have been reported infected with HPAI.

""Let's remember that until last week [first of Mar 2023] the focus was on the Antofagasta region, with 2 sea lions and 2 penguins, and today we already have confirmation of affected marine mammals in the Arica and Parinacota, and Tarapacá regions,"" confirmed the national director of Sernapesca.

This case (marine otter) also corresponds to the variant of the H5 virus that has already been detected in wild birds in 12 regions of the country, and that is present in countries of the northern and southern hemispheres.

The entity that controls fishing and aquaculture activity, SERNAPESCA, indicated that they have activated a special plan to address this contingency. On the one hand, a territorial deployment that consists of a special surveillance system in coastal areas identified as at risk, and, on the other hand, to strengthen the notification systems, in order to determine early cases of avian influenza in marine animals. In addition, work is being done in coordination with the presidential delegations of the northern zone regions where positive cases have been documented, the SAG, MINSAL [Ministry of Health], SENAPRED [National Service For Disaster Prevention And Response], and other regional and local authorities, such as municipalities.

In addition to the measures mentioned above, SERNAPESCA and the Undersecretary of Fisheries and Aquaculture, SUBPESCA, have been working together since February [2023] at the level of authorities and with expert technical teams, to safeguard the health of those who carry out various jobs associated with artisanal fishing and other sectoral agents that cohabit with marine species susceptible to contagion with avian influenza, or that maintain higher levels of interactions with marine fauna, by coordinating a series of training workshops, especially in places identified as high risk. ""Through our regional directorates and the fishing zones of the Undersecretary, we will train our users in biosecurity measures, to avoid risky manipulation. Our interest is that men and women of the sea remain safe,"" said Tapia.

[Infections by HPAI viruses in mammals were typically not common, but since April 2022 there has been a growing number of events of Eurasian HPAI H5N1 in a wide spectrum of wild carnivores (order Carnivora). There have been reports in red foxes (_Vulpes vulpes_, family Canidae), bobcats and mountain lions (family Felidae), skunks (family Mephitidae), raccoons (family Procyonidae), bears (family Ursidae), otters and minks (family Mustelidae), seals and sea lions (suborder Pinnipedia, families Phocidae and Otariidae, respectively). There have also been cases in cetaceans.

The marine otter (_Lontra felina_) is a rare South American mustelid that only lives in saltwater environments. Marine otters are rare and are protected under Peruvian, Chilean, and Argentinian laws, and are classified as endangered by the IUCN. (International Union for Conservation of Nature).

Leptospirosis in Durán [Guayas province] gains ground due to stagnant waters and unsanitary conditions.

The garbage collection car passes up to 3 times a day. But that's far from keeping the sidewalks clean. And at all times the sidewalks and gutters remain full of bags with scattered garbage, flies, and dogs prowling the waste. In addition, stagnant water from the rains aggravates the leptospirosis problem in Durán.

On a tour of the 1st and 2nd stages of El Recreo de Durán, EL COMERCIO verified unsanitary conditions. El Recreo concentrates 12 cases of leptospirosis out of the 18 detected in the province of Guayas.

Another 4 cases are located in other sectors of Durán. The Ministry of Public Health (MSP) reported 2 infected in Guayaquil. The disease is transmitted by the urine of rats [contaminating] stagnant water and in contact with human skin. And the urine of infected dogs and cats also transmits the bacteria [_Leptospira_] that cause the disease.

On Monday morning, [6 Mar 2023], a resident of El Recreo II was helping a street sweeper from the municipal company uncover a rainwater grate covered with mud. The sinkhole was located next to a mound of garbage full of flies and the dogs sniffed the open covers.

At 10:00 a.m., the garbage collection truck had not yet passed through the sector, when it usually does around 8:00 a.m. ""The collection car sometimes comes late; it does not have a fixed schedule, but not everything is the fault of the collection. Some neighbors throw open garbage bags on the corner. And others wait for the truck to pass to take out the waste,"" said the man.

The poor disposal of garbage, even at night, favors the proliferation of rats and leptospirosis in Durán. Jesús Narváez, a pharmacist in the sector, says that intensive education campaigns for the population are required, followed by ordinances and fines for bad neighbors.

An MSP brigade passed fumigating and offering talks on the morning [6 Mar 2023]. But in one block they could only reach 6 homes and the brigade workers were harassed by crime, said Narváez.

The stench emanates from corners that have become large garbage dumps. In Colinas de El Recreo, the waste rots in a flooded area next to the railways. An entire body of water remains full of garbage. ""The smell is unbearable, the truck only picks up the bags that are left on the shore,"" says a neighbor.

Leptospirosis cases produce symptoms such as fever, chills, headaches, muscle pain, and abdominal pain, as well as vomiting, diarrhea, and yellowing of the eyes and skin. The authorities urge residents to consult a doctor or go to a health center before signs of alarm.

The infection mainly affects the kidneys. People are urged to avoid environments contaminated by animal urine and when in contact with stagnant water, it is recommended to clean the skin with plenty of clean water and soap.

Lucy Jurado, Zonal 8 coordinator of the MSP, informed that the cases of leptospirosis in Durán and Guayaquil are so far uncomplicated. The State agency is executing a disease prevention plan. Antibiotics [doxycycline] can cure the infection and the pathogen is usually eliminated from the urine after a week. But without treatment, it can cause kidney and liver damage, or even death.

[Heavy rainfall in February 2023 caused freshwater flooding in multiple regions of Ecuador (<https://floodlist.com/america/ecuador-floods-february-2023>), but flooding in Duran is being compounded by mounds of garbage that are blocking drainage of the floodwater and attracting rats, dogs, and other animals that likely excrete _Leptospira_ in their urine, contaminating the floodwater.

Many species of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and rats) are susceptible to chronic kidney infection with pathogenic _Leptospira_. Leptospirosis is usually acquired after contact of the skin or mucous membranes with the urine of infected animals or by contact with fresh water, wet soil, or vegetation that has been contaminated by the urine of leptospira-infected animals, especially rats. _Leptospira_ shed in the urine of chronically infected animals may survive in freshwater or moist soil for weeks to months.

For the 1st time, a case of tickborne relapsing fever (TBRF) related to the _Borrelia lonestari_ organism has been found in an Alabama man, according to the CDC.

The patient, a 75-year-old [immunocompromised] Alabama resident, sought treatment at The Kirklin Clinic of the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), during April 2019, for extreme fatigue and relapsing fevers accompanied by chills, sweating, headache, and dizziness (Emerg Infect Dis 2023; 29(2): 441-4; [see below]). He indicated that the symptoms had been recurring one to 2 times per week for the previous month.

The patient reported having removed an attached tick approximately 4 weeks before symptom onset.

Oral doxycycline treatment was initiated. The patient developed a fever and became stuporous following the 1st dose, but he stabilized and was able to complete a 10-day course of treatment without additional complications.

""The potential for _B. lonestari_ to cause disease, and if so what type of disease, has been rather mysterious,"" researcher Joshua A Lieberman, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of laboratory medicine in the Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology at the University of Washington, in Seattle, told Infectious Disease Special Edition.

PCR testing of a blood sample taken from the patient was analyzed by the University of Washington Medical Center molecular microbiology laboratory. The test had 100% identity to three published 16S rRNA gene sequences from _B. lonestari_ (GenBank accession nos. AY166715, AY682921 and U23211), and 99.79% identity to another published 16S rRNA gene sequence from _B. lonestari_ (GenBank accession no. AY682920).

Although _B. lonestari_ was initially proposed as the cause of southern tick-associated rash illness, following bites from lone star ticks, efforts to isolate the bacterium in biopsies of rashes have largely been unsuccessful.

""This case report sheds light onto the potential of _B. lonestari_ to cause human illness and contributes to the body of knowledge on TBRF,"" Laia J Vazquez Guillamet, MD, an infectious disease specialist at UAB, told Infectious Disease Special Edition. ""It is the 2nd tickborne _Borrelia_ species transmitted by hard ticks that has been identified as a causative agent of relapsing fever, being the previous ones transmitted by soft ticks.""

Additionally, Dr Vazquez Guillamet said the report ""expands the known geographical distribution of potential etiologic agents of relapsing fever in the US, including many southeastern states where _B. lonestari_ has been detected in both ticks and vertebrate hosts."" However, it is important to highlight that this bacterium and this human illness are uncommonly reported in those states, she added. ""Discovering this organism in a classic case of relapsing fever makes genetic sense because it is within the 'relapsing fever' group of _Borrelia_ species, not the Lyme disease group,"" Dr Lieberman said.

Dr Lieberman did note that some questions remain unanswered. ""We don't know whether the patient developed relapsing fever because _B. lonestari_ is always a true pathogen, because he was immunocompromised, or both,"" he said. ""Hopefully, future work will help resolve this.""

Dr Vazquez Guillamet added that the increasing availability of molecular diagnostics may help continue to illuminate the role of _B. lonestari_ as an emerging tickborne pathogen. ""In future years, increased awareness of the pathogenic potential of _B. lonestari_ and the use of molecular diagnostics may give us an approximation about the real burden of human illness caused by this bacterium,"" she said.

Abstract
--------
""We report an immunocompromised patient in Alabama, USA, 75 years of age, with relapsing fevers and pancytopenia who had spirochetemia after a tick bite. We identified _Borrelia lonestari_ by using PCR, sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. Increasing clinical availability of molecular diagnostics might identify _B. lonestari_ as an emerging tickborne pathogen.""

----
The relapsing-fever group of _Borrelia_, which includes _B. hermsii_ and _B. miyamotoi_, is genetically diverse and causes a disease characterized by a high temperature that cyclically remits. _B. hermsii_ is the most frequent cause of tick-borne relapsing fever in the USA. This spirochete is transmitted to humans by the soft tick _Ornithodoros hermsi_, which transmits spirochetes through a brief (less than 30 minutes duration) and painless nocturnal bite. Humans typically are exposed to these ticks during an overnight stay in rodent-infested dwellings at elevations greater than 2000 feet (610 m). In the USA, a majority of the reported _B. hermsii_ cases are from California and Washington State. Louse-borne relapsing fever, an illness similar to the tick-borne disease, is caused by _Borrelia recurrentis_, which is transmitted from human to human by the body louse and is spread under conditions of crowding and poor personal hygiene. It remains endemic in parts of central and east Africa and the South American Andes but has occasionally been imported into the USA.

The patient in the case report above had a history of low grade follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma and was receiving maintenance rituximab therapy. The patient had not traveled out of Alabama for several years but reported that he had removed an attached tick 4 weeks before symptom onset. During the 3 months before the diagnosis was confirmed, pancytopenia (anemia, leucopenia, and thrombocytopenia), mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase, and hepatosplenomegaly were noted. Spirochetes were seen in the peripheral blood smear and empirical oral treatment (100 mg doxycycline 2x/d) was initiated immediately. A Jarisch-Herxheimer-like reaction occurred after initiation of antimicrobial therapy, but he then completed a full 10-day course of doxycycline. His pancytopenia resolved in the subsequent months. The spirochete was identified genetically as _B. lonestarii_.

_B. lonestari_ has been detected in the hard lone star tick, _Amblyomma americanum_, in southeastern states and has been thought to be the cause of southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI) occurring after _A. americanum_ tick bites. _B. lonestari_ infection had previously been identified in an elderly patient with an erythema migrans-like rash that developed after an _A. americanum_ tick bite; PCR identified _B. lonestari_ in both a skin biopsy and the removed tick in this patient (<https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11372036/>). The _B. lonestari_ clade is most closely related to _B. miyamotoi_, another _Borrelia_ species causing hard tick (_Ixodes_) relapsing fever.

In the USA, _B. miyamotoi_ has been detected in _Ixodes scapularis_, in Russia and Japan in _I. persulcatus_ (Fukunaga M, Takahashi Y, Tsuruta Y, et al: Genetic and phenotypic analysis of _Borrelia miyamotoi_ sp. nov., isolated from the ixodid tick _Ixodes persulcatus_, the vector for Lyme disease in Japan.

.................................................sb/ml/mj/ml","For the 1st time, a case of tickborne relapsing fever (TBRF) related to the _Borrelia lonestari_ organism has been found in an Alabama man, according to the CDC.The patient, a 75-year-old [immunocompromised] Alabama resident, sought treatment at The Kirklin Clinic of the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), during April 2019, for extreme fatigue and relapsing fevers accompanied by chills, sweating, headache, and dizziness (Emerg Infect Dis 2023; 29(2): 441-4; [see below]). He indicated that the symptoms had been recurring one to 2 times per week for the previous month.The patient reported having removed an attached tick approximately 4 weeks before symptom onset.Oral doxycycline treatment was initiated. The patient developed a fever and became stuporous following the 1st dose, but he stabilized and was able to complete a 10-day course of treatment without additional complications.""The potential for _B. lonestari_ to cause disease, and if so what type of disease, has been rather mysterious,"" researcher Joshua A Lieberman, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of laboratory medicine in the Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology at the University of Washington, in Seattle, told Infectious Disease Special Edition.PCR testing of a blood sample taken from the patient was analyzed by the University of Washington Medical Center molecular microbiology laboratory. The test had 100% identity to three published 16S rRNA gene sequences from _B. lonestari_ (GenBank accession nos. AY166715, AY682921 and U23211), and 99.79% identity to another published 16S rRNA gene sequence from _B. lonestari_ (GenBank accession no. AY682920).Although _B. lonestari_ was initially proposed as the cause of southern tick-associated rash illness, following bites from lone star ticks, efforts to isolate the bacterium in biopsies of rashes have largely been unsuccessful.""This case report sheds light onto the potential of _B. lonestari_ to cause human illness and contributes to the body of knowledge on TBRF,"" Laia J Vazquez Guillamet, MD, an infectious disease specialist at UAB, told Infectious Disease Special Edition. ""It is the 2nd tickborne _Borrelia_ species transmitted by hard ticks that has been identified as a causative agent of relapsing fever, being the previous ones transmitted by soft ticks.""Additionally, Dr Vazquez Guillamet said the report ""expands the known geographical distribution of potential etiologic agents of relapsing fever in the US, including many southeastern states where _B. lonestari_ has been detected in both ticks and vertebrate hosts."" However, it is important to highlight that this bacterium and this human illness are uncommonly reported in those states, she added. ""Discovering this organism in a classic case of relapsing fever makes genetic sense because it is within the 'relapsing fever' group of _Borrelia_ species, not the Lyme disease group,"" Dr Lieberman said.Dr Lieberman did note that some questions remain unanswered. ""We don't know whether the patient developed relapsing fever because _B. lonestari_ is always a true pathogen, because he was immunocompromised, or both,"" he said. ""Hopefully, future work will help resolve this.""Dr Vazquez Guillamet added that the increasing availability of molecular diagnostics may help continue to illuminate the role of _B. lonestari_ as an emerging tickborne pathogen. ""In future years, increased awareness of the pathogenic potential of _B. lonestari_ and the use of molecular diagnostics may give us an approximation about the real burden of human illness caused by this bacterium,"" she said.[Byline: Ethan Covey]--Communicated by:ProMED[The citation and the abstract of the journal article referenced in the news report above follow:Vazquez Guillamet LJ, Marx GE, Benjamin W, et al.

This spirochete is transmitted to humans by the soft tick _Ornithodoros hermsi_, which transmits spirochetes through a brief (less than 30 minutes duration) and painless nocturnal bite.

Wisconsin health experts are seeing a consistent and continuing rise in strep throat infections, the latest respiratory disease to plague patients through the winter.

Dr Greg DeMuri, a pediatric infectious disease doctor for UW [University of Wisconsin] Health Kids and professor at UW-Madison's School of Medicine and Public Health, said this year's [2023] strep season has been unlike anything he's seen in his decade studying and treating the disease.

The good news is that there are many things you can do to keep yourself and loved ones safe, and doctors can effectively treat strep infections with antibiotics.

Here's what you need to know.
- What is strep throat? Strep throat is one of several diseases caused by group A _Streptococcus_ bacteria. It's a common childhood disease that mostly hits kids ages 5 to 15. By one estimate, about a quarter of cases of pharyngitis (sore throat) in kids are caused by strep infection, according to Milwaukee County Chief Health Policy Advisor and Froedtert Hospital emergency department physician Ben Weston.

But anyone at any age can get strep throat, and in recent months, health experts have been monitoring an increase in a rare but serious type of strep infection, called invasive group A strep infections.

Strep throat symptoms include sore throat, fever, swollen lymph nodes, and fatigue. People might have red and white patches in the throat, enlarged tonsils, and experience nausea or vomiting, fever, and/or headaches. The bacteria that cause strep throat can also cause tonsillitis, cellulitis, and impetigo, a mild but highly-contagious condition that causes skin sores.

- How does strep throat spread? With strep throat, bacteria spread most commonly through respiratory droplets and direct contact, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That includes droplets from talking, coughing, sneezing, and sharing eating utensils and dishes. In the case of impetigo, the bacteria can spread from touching an infected person's skin sores.

This year [2023], strep throat has been spreading more. The best way to address it is to see a doctor for a test and antibiotic treatment, [if the tests are positive].

[For a discussion of group A streptococcal (GAS) infections, please see my moderator comments in ProMED posts Streptococcus, gp A update (05): UK, fatal, scarlet fever, iGAS 20221231.8707549 and Streptococcus, gp A update (06): Denmark, invasive, new subvariant, RFI 20230222.8708507.

Group A streptococcus (GAS) commonly causes pharyngitis, local suppurative extensions to involve the middle ear (otitis media) and sinuses (mastoiditis), and superficial skin infections, but can also cause invasive GAS (iGAS) infections, including bacteremia, necrotizing fasciitis, toxic shock syndrome, endocarditis, puerperal sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis. Serious non-suppurative sequelae, such as acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease, and glomerulonephritis may also occur after GAS pharyngitis.

GAS can be highly contagious; skin lesions, poor personal hygiene, and crowding in shelters for the homeless would be expected to facilitate its spread from person to person.

Some strains of GAS are more virulent than others. Tissue invasiveness of GAS has been attributed to several virulence factors, especially the cell wall M protein, encoded by the emm gene. Strains have been typed based on the antigenic specificity of its M protein. More recently GAS are typed based on sequence analysis of the portion of the emm gene that encodes M serospecificity (<https://www.cdc.gov/streplab/groupa-strep/emm-background.html>). Over 200 emm types have been identified. Molecular analysis of the isolates' emm aids in documenting a common source of an outbreak.

In the UK, in 2016, 84% of all emm1 strains isolated upper respiratory GAS isolates had a distinctive emm type 1 (designated M1UK) (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6838661/>). The iGAS isolates collected in the same period in the UK were also M1UK (<https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(19)30446-3/fulltext>). M1UK was found to produce 9 times more streptococcal exotoxin than previous versions of emm type 1 isolates. In Denmark in January 2023, 35% of the total iGAS cases were due to a new subvariant GAS that has not previously been seen in Denmark (ProMED post Streptococcus, gp A update (06): Denmark, invasive, new subvariant, RFI 20230222.8708507). However, details describing the characteristics of this new subvariant strain were not given. - Mod.ML

A large number of wild [see comment] goats, which have been a long-standing problem for the inhabitants of the small Adriatic island of Unije [of the Cres-Lošinj archipelago] are infected with Q fever.

As 'Novi List' writes, tissue samples from dead or shot animals show this, with the note that this infection in humans can cause symptoms similar to flu or pneumonia, and in a small number of cases, damage to the heart, brain, liver, and lungs.

According to estimates, there are about 400 to 500 of these animals, and as revealed by Robert Nikolić, the president of the Council of the local committee of the Union, they were brought to the island in the late '70s and early '80s. The Lošinj company Jadranka had sheep there, so the goal was to speed up the maquis and clear the land for the growth of grass and grazing for their sheep.

""What happened, however, was that they multiplied beyond measure, so now they are also a problem for the island's shepherds, because they also graze the grass that the sheep grazed,"" he said, noting that they tried to solve the problem in communication with the Town of Mali and others. ""The city and the county refer us to the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Ministry simply ignored all our letters, calls, and requests. We never received any response,"" he told the media.

He also points out that at the beginning of February [2023] they shot 16 goats, 11 of which were infected with Q fever, as shown by the analysis of samples at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in Zagreb.

By the way, last year [2022] in the Rijeka area [continental Croatia, facing the archipelago], several locals fell ill from this zoonosis, which is most often transmitted to humans by sheep, goats, or cows. In animals, it is usually not noticed, while in humans the symptoms are high fever, general malaise, and cough, and the disease can therefore be mistaken for flu or COVID-19.

The causative agent is rickettsia _Coxiella burnetii_, which spreads through urine, feces, milk, and especially placenta and amniotic fluid after parturition and/or abortion. Those who are in more frequent contact with animals are exposed to a greater risk of disease, and infection mostly occurs in the lambing season, i.e., in the spring. People most often get sick by inhaling contaminated air and dust.

[Unije, an island in Croatia (map at <https://tinyurl.com/2p8xn5p5>), is part of the Cres-Lošinj archipelago, situated at the northern portion of the Adriatic Sea. It is 16.92 square kilometres (6.53 square miles) in size. The only settlement on the island, bearing the same name, contains, reportedly, 280 houses. Its year-round population is less than 85 residents, growing to more than 400 residents during the tourist season.

The goats, referred to in the above media report as 'wild goats' (_Capra aegagrus_), are rather feral goats, genetically similar to the domestic goat (_Capra hircus_), stated to be introduced from the mainland about 40-45 years ago. They are presented in a video clip included in the media report (<https://youtu.be/sf_D3G1tVcQ>). It will be interesting to note if the feral goats on Unije are related to Croatia's iconic, almost extinct Istrian goat breed (see at <https://phys.org/news/2021-04-croatia-iconic-istrian-goat.html>).

In March 2022, an outbreak of Q fever with non-occupational exposure was confirmed in a semi-urban area in Čavle, Croatia. Veterinary and human epidemiological investigations were conducted to identify the source of the outbreak and to implement appropriate control measures. The investigation revealed airborne transmission, from 3 nearby farms that held infected sheep and goats, as the most likely route of transmission. Among the animal samples analysed, all 16 goats (100%) and 24/50 sheep (48%) tested positive for _C. burnetii_ IgM/IgG antibodies, phase I and II. Persons who were near the farms (about 750  m [0.5 mi]) and lived in the nearest street to the farms had the highest risk of contracting Q fever. This was the largest Q fever outbreak in the county in the last 16  years, unexpected due to its location and non-occupational exposure. To stop the outbreak, numerous intensive biosecurity measures were implemented. As indicated in the paper, vaccination of animals and humans against Q fever is not implemented in Croatia due to the low incidence of infection (<https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/zph.13022>).

We never received any response,"" he told the media.He also points out that at the beginning of February [2023] they shot 16 goats, 11 of which were infected with Q fever, as shown by the analysis of samples at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in Zagreb.By the way, last year [2022] in the Rijeka area [continental Croatia, facing the archipelago], several locals fell ill from this zoonosis, which is most often transmitted to humans by sheep, goats, or cows. In animals, it is usually not noticed, while in humans the symptoms are high fever, general malaise, and cough, and the disease can therefore be mistaken for flu or COVID-19.The causative agent is rickettsia _Coxiella burnetii_, which spreads through urine, feces, milk, and especially placenta and amniotic fluid after parturition and/or abortion. Those who are in more frequent contact with animals are exposed to a greater risk of disease, and infection mostly occurs in the lambing season, i.e., in the spring. People most often get sick by inhaling contaminated air and dust.--Communicated by:ProMED[Unije, an island in Croatia (map at <https://tinyurl.com/2p8xn5p5>), is part of the Cres-Lošinj archipelago, situated at the northern portion of the Adriatic Sea. It is 16.92 square kilometres (6.53 square miles) in size. The only settlement on the island, bearing the same name, contains, reportedly, 280 houses. Its year-round population is less than 85 residents, growing to more than 400 residents during the tourist season.The goats, referred to in the above media report as 'wild goats' (_Capra aegagrus_), are rather feral goats, genetically similar to the domestic goat (_Capra hircus_), stated to be introduced from the mainland about 40-45 years ago. They are presented in a video clip included in the media report (<https://youtu.be/sf_D3G1tVcQ>). It will be interesting to note if the feral goats on Unije are related to Croatia's iconic, almost extinct Istrian goat breed (see at <https://phys.org/news/2021-04-croatia-iconic-istrian-goat.html>).In March 2022, an outbreak of Q fever with non-occupational exposure was confirmed in a semi-urban area in Čavle, Croatia. Veterinary and human epidemiological investigations were conducted to identify the source of the outbreak and to implement appropriate control measures. The investigation revealed airborne transmission, from 3 nearby farms that held infected sheep and goats, as the most likely route of transmission. Among the animal samples analysed, all 16 goats (100%) and 24/50 sheep (48%) tested positive for _C. burnetii_ IgM/IgG antibodies, phase I and II. Persons who were near the farms (about 750  m [0.5 mi]) and lived in the nearest street to the farms had the highest risk of contracting Q fever. This was the largest Q fever outbreak in the county in the last 16  years, unexpected due to its location and non-occupational exposure. To stop the outbreak, numerous intensive biosecurity measures were implemented. As indicated in the paper, vaccination of animals and humans against Q fever is not implemented in Croatia due to the low incidence of infection (<https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/zph.13022>).For more information on Q fever in humans and animals, subscribers are invited to visit the recent moderators' commentaries in ProMED post 20230228.8708632. - Mod.ASProMED map:Primorsko-Goranska Županija, Primorsko-Goranska, Croatia: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8708806,68692>]","Agroklub (Agricultural portal, Croatia)",,

- Number of states affected: 10 / 22 / 21
- Local government areas (LGAs) affected: 24 / 88 / 79

Highlights

- In week 8, the number of new confirmed cases increased from 46 in week 7 2023 to 59 cases. These were reported from Benue, Bauchi, Ondo, Taraba, Edo, Ebonyi, Kano, Jigawa, FCT, and Kogi states (Table 3).
- Cumulatively from week 1 to week 8, 2023, 104 deaths have been reported with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 16.4%, which is lower than the CFR for the same period in 2022 (18.1%).
- In total for 2023, 22 states have recorded at least one confirmed case across 88 LGAs (Figures 2 and 3)
- Seventy percent (70%) of all confirmed Lassa fever cases were reported from 3 states (Ondo, Edo, and Bauchi), while 30% were reported from 7 states with confirmed Lassa fever cases. Of the 70% confirmed cases, Ondo reported 33%, Edo 28%, and Taraba 9%.
- The predominant age group affected is 21-30 years (range: 1 to 93 years, median age: 31 years). The male-to-female ratio for confirmed cases is 1:0.9 (Figure 4).
- The number of suspected cases increased compared to that reported for the same period in 2022.
- 4 new healthcare workers were affected in the reporting week 8.
- National Lassa fever multi-partner, multi-sectoral Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) activated to coordinate the response activities at all levels.

Challenges
- Late presentation of cases leading to an increase in CFR
- Poor health-seeking behaviour due to the high cost of treatment and clinical management of Lassa fever
- Poor environmental sanitation conditions observed in high-burden communities
- Poor awareness observed in high-burden communities

Notes on this report
Data source
Information for this disease was case-based data retrieved from the National Lassa fever Emergency Operations Centre.

Case definitions
- Suspected case:
Any individual presenting with one or more of the following: malaise, fever, headache, sore throat, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, myalgia, chest pain, hearing loss and either
a. history of contact with excreta or urine of rodents; or
b. history of contact with a probable or confirmed Lassa fever case within a period of 21 days of onset of symptoms, OR
c. any person with inexplicable bleeding/hemorrhagia
- Confirmed case:
Any suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody, PCR, or virus isolation).
- Probable case
Any suspected case (see definition above) who died or absconded without collection of specimen for laboratory testing.
- Contact
Anyone who has been exposed to an infected person, or to an infected person's secretions, excretions, or tissues within 3 weeks of last contact with a confirmed or probable case of Lassa fever.

Calculations
- Case fatality rate (CFR) for this disease is reported for confirmed cases only.

[Nigeria may be passing the season of the year (weeks 3-10) when cases increase the most. The number of cases may have peaked earlier this year [2023] during weeks 2-5. The graph in Figure 6 shows an early and relatively higher peak in case numbers so far this year (2023) compared to earlier years. There were 59 new confirmed and 351 new suspected Lassa fever (LF) cases in week 8 (20-26 Feb 2023), indicating that LF virus transmission is decreasing. There were 10 deaths among the confirmed cases for week 8, 2023. There were 4 newly infected healthcare worker reported in week 8.

The report above confirms that Ondo, Edo, Bauchi, and Taraba states have the most confirmed cases. The number of states affected is 22 so far this year (2023), and the number of local government areas (LGAs) with at least one case is 88.

Transmission of LF virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir host excreta or are within healthcare facilities. It is encouraging to learn from previous reports this year (2023) that risk communications and community engagement activities have been scaled up across states in Nigeria using television, radio, print, social media, and other strategies for avoidance of contact with rodent virus reservoirs and their excreta. These efforts may have contributed to the decline in the number of cases over the past month.

One hopes that the ongoing public information campaign will help the local population to avoid the entry of these reservoir rodents into their houses and other buildings. - Mod.TY

Another species of deer has been detected suffering from chronic wasting disease (CWD) in Manitoba, according to the province.

CWD was first detected in Manitoba in 2021 in mule deer. Now the province said it has also been found in white-tailed deer.

""CWD is an incurable, fatal disease affecting members of the deer family (cervids),"" the province said in a news release. ""If the disease spreads and becomes endemic to Manitoba, there is a serious risk CWD will threaten the health of all cervid populations in the province.""

Since it was first detected, there have been 20 positive cases found in Manitoba: 18 mule deer and 2 white-tailed deer. [These 2 deer must have come into the laboratory fairly close to the same time. - Mod.TG]

More positive tests could be discovered, as the province said wait times for tests are around 16 to 20 weeks, as there have been more submissions than capacity for testing.

The province said CWD is not known to impact people, but the meat of a CWD-infected animal should not be eaten.

""Hunters who are active in areas where CWD is a concern should have harvested animals tested, practice safe carcass-handling protocols, and avoid consumption of any animal having tested positive for CWD.""

Sample results can be found online, and more information can be found on the government's website at <https://www.gov.mb.ca/nrnd/fish-wildlife/wildlife/cwd.html>.

Health authorities in Bangladesh have reported 3 additional Nipah virus cases, including 2 additional deaths, according to a recent report. This is up from 11 cases and 8 deaths reported a little over 2 weeks ago.

According to the Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) in Dhaka, from January 2023 as of 4 Mar 2023, a total of 14 Nipah cases are identified through the surveillance system.

The new cases are reported from Manda upazila in Naogaon district in the Division of Rajshahi in western Bangladesh.

This outbreak is related to the consumption of date palm sap.

[There is no information about the 3 new cases other than 2 of them died and their locations in Bangladesh.

A new disease caused solely by plastics has been discovered in seabirds.

The birds identified as having the disease, named plasticosis, have scarred digestive tracts from ingesting waste, scientists at the Natural History Museum in London say.

It is the 1st recorded instance of specifically plastic-induced fibrosis in wild animals, researchers say.

Plastic pollution is becoming so prevalent that the scarring was widespread across different ages of birds, according to the study, published in the Journal of Hazardous Materials [see reference below].

Young birds were found to have the disease, and it is thought chicks were being fed the plastic pollution by parents accidentally bringing it back in food.

Scientists, including the Natural History Museum's Dr Alex Bond and Dr Jennifer Lavers, studied flesh-footed shearwaters from Australia's Lord Howe Island [Tasman, Sea, Unincorporated area of New South Wales] to look at the relationship between levels of ingested plastic and the proventriculus organ -- the 1st part of a bird's stomach.

They found that the more plastic a bird had ingested, the more scarring it had. The disease can lead to the gradual breakdown of tubular glands in the proventriculus. Losing these glands can cause the birds to become more vulnerable to infection and parasites and affect their ability to digest food and absorb some vitamins.

Researchers called the fibrotic disease plasticosis to make it clear that it was caused by plastic in the environment.

When birds ingest small pieces of plastic, they found, it inflames the digestive tract. Over time, the persistent inflammation causes tissues to become scarred and disfigured, affecting digestion, growth, and survival.

Natural materials found in the stomachs of birds, such as pumice stones, did not cause the same problems, leading scientists to label this a specifically plastic-caused disease.

Bond, principal curator in charge of birds at the Natural History Museum, said: ""While these birds can look healthy on the outside, they're not doing well on the inside. This study is the 1st time that stomach tissue has been investigated in this way and shows that plastic consumption can cause serious damage to these birds' digestive system.""

Though the scientists studied only one species of bird in one part of the world, they believe it is likely that more species are affected, and say more research is needed to find out how widespread plasticosis is.

They say the exposure of all organisms to plastic is inevitable because plastic emissions are increasing and plastic pollution is becoming prevalent in all environments globally.

As this problem has only emerged in recent decades, it has not been widely studied. The researchers said: ""Further, the ingestion of plastic has far-reaching and severe consequences, many of which we are only just beginning to fully document and understand.""

Abstract
--------
""As biota are increasingly exposed to plastic pollution, there is a need to closely examine the sub-lethal 'hidden' impacts of plastic ingestion. This emerging field of study has been limited to model species in controlled laboratory settings, with little data available for wild, free-living organisms. Highly impacted by plastic ingestion, flesh-footed shearwaters (_Ardenna carneipes_) are thus an apt species to examine these impacts in an environmentally relevant manner. A Masson's Trichrome stain was used to document any evidence of plastic-induced fibrosis, using collagen as a marker for scar tissue formation in the proventriculus (stomach) of 30 flesh-footed shearwater fledglings from Lord Howe Island, Australia. Plastic presence was highly associated with widespread scar tissue formation and extensive changes to, and even loss of, tissue structure within the mucosa and submucosa. Additionally, despite naturally occurring indigestible items, such as pumice, also being found in the gastrointestinal tract, this did not cause similar scarring. This highlights the unique pathological properties of plastics and raises concerns for other species impacted by plastic ingestion. Further, the extent and severity of fibrosis documented in this study gives support for a novel, plastic-induced fibrotic disease, which we define as 'plasticosis'.""

Over 300 million tonnes of plastic are produced each year, 10 million tonnes of which enter the ocean and accumulate. This is a clear demonstration that the growing exposure to micro- and macro-plastics may have a considerable impact on the health dynamics of marine wildlife. - Mod.PMB

On Monday morning [6 Mar 2023] the Santa Fe Health Ministry confirmed the death of a patient from [a] hantavirus [infection].

According to information in a press release, ""The patient began to have symptoms on 13 Feb 2023 and died on 15 Feb  2023 while hospitalized in the Reconquista Hospital.""

The government indicated that the patient who died ""was a young male from the Florencia locality"" and explained that ""given the suspicion about the [etiology of the] case, the territorial teams carried out barrier precautions. To date, no people with symptoms compatible with hantavirus [infections] have been registered.""

The clinical picture of hantavirus disease is characterized by a short-duration prodromal phase (average 4-6 days) in which the patient presents with fever, myalgia, fatigue, headache, and sometimes, a gastrointestinal picture with vomiting and diarrhea. In the most severe cases, the disease rapidly progresses to a cardiopulmonary phase, presenting respiratory distress and serious hemodynamic changes. The case fatality rate varies between 16 and 50% depending on the region of the country.

Laboratory findings include thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis with atypical lymphocytes, and elevated transaminases; acute renal failure can be found.

Transmission [of the virus] to humans can include:
- Areas where inhalation or direct contact with secretions with the virus from saliva, urine, or excrement of [infected] rodents.
- Transmission between people is infrequent and just with certain genotypes of the Andes virus that can occur within 48-72 hours from the beginning of fever.

Inter-human transmission with the [virus] genotypes circulating in Santa Fe province has not been reported.

[There is no indication of the specific environmental setting where this man might have acquired his infection. The health agency's investigation may determine that and presumably would inform the public in that locality about preventive measures for avoiding infection.

The virus involved with this unfortunate fatal case is not stated. Andes virus is unlikely because the range of its rodent host, the long-tailed pygmy rice rat, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_, is far to the west and south of Santa Fe in the Andes mountains and foothills of Argentina and Chile (a map of the distribution of the pygmy rice rat can be seen at <https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Map-of-the-distribution-of-Oligoryzomys-longicaudatus-in-Chile-and-Argentina-shaded_fig2_236214891>).

As noted in ProMED archive no. 20110430.1348, several endemic hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in Argentina: Andes virus (in western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina, rodent host unknown); Maciel virus (in the dark bolo mouse, _Bolomys obscurus_); Lechiguana and Central Plata (in central Argentina, in the yellow pygmy rice rat, _O. flavescens_); Oran (in northwestern Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat, _O. longicaudatus_); Anajatuba and Juquitiba viruses (in Fornes's pygmy rice rat, _O. fornesi_); and Bermejo virus (in western Argentina; in Chacoan pygmy rice rat, _O. chacoensis_). There is always the possibility of infection with Seoul hantavirus, widely distributed in the world in brown rats (_Rattus norvegicus_). Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved in this case in Santa Fe province. - Mod.TY

[1] Hong Kong: COVID-19 mask mandates 
Date: Thu 2 Mar 2023
Source: Financial Times [subscription required, abridged, edited]
<https://www.ft.com/content/e5d7fa78-642a-4189-8e83-bdbaad5ee172>


Asian financial hub was one of the last places to lift the mandate but many prefer to keep faces covered.

The Asian financial centre lifted its mask mandate this week after 945 days, making it one of the last places in the world to do so. But on [Wed 1 Mar 2023], the first time in almost 3 years that masks were not mandatory in classrooms or outdoors, only about 80 of the school's 700 students did not wear a mask.

Their reluctance was not unusual -- the vast majority of Hong Kong residents continue to wear a mask outdoors.

At the height of its COVID-19 outbreak last year [2022], Hong Kong's excess death rate was the worst in the world. But for most of the pandemic, Hong Kong pursued a zero-COVID policy, though a softer version than that implemented in mainland China, meaning the former British colony was effectively free of the virus for months at a time.

More than 93% of Hong Kong's 7.3 million population has now received 2 doses of a COVID-19 vaccine, and health experts said immunity had been built up. But mask-wearing may stem from high levels of anxiety about catching COVID-19 or feelings of ""perceived personal control"", Hui said.

Elsewhere in east Asia, people have also continued to wear masks.

Japan, which never imposed an official mask mandate, eased guidelines on masks from [13 Mar 2023], including for schools and public transport except during rush hour, when face coverings were still recommended but not enforced.

South Korea scrapped a mask mandate for most indoor public places except on public transport and in medical facilities in January [2023], after lifting the outdoor mask mandate in September [2022]. But many citizens continue to wear masks, and most students cover their faces in class. 

Singapore has mostly dropped its mask rules, which were previously some of the strictest in Asia, with residents risking fines and jail time if caught without a face covering.

The city-state lifted its outdoor mask mandate in March last year [2022], followed by indoors a few months later. Face coverings are no longer required on public transport as of last month. Coupled with year-round hot temperatures, mask-wearing is now minimal.

Mask use was prevalent in the region long before the COVID-19 pandemic. During the spring in South Korea, the government encourages mask-wearing to prevent respiratory problems from thick yellow dust that seasonally blows in from the Chinese desert.

Hongkongers in particular learned that masks could be effective at slowing the spread of respiratory disease during the deadly 2003 SARS epidemic, which killed almost 300 people, with a fatality rate of about 1%. Prior to COVID-19, people suffering from colds and influenza often wore face coverings on public transport and in workplaces.

[2] XBB.1.5: CDC severity guidance
Date: Fri 24 Feb 2023

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says there appears to be no significant difference in disease severity between a quickly spreading omicron subvariant of the coronavirus and a previously dominant strain.

The omicron subvariant known as XBB.1.5 started to spread in the United States around last December [2022]. It is now estimated to account for some 80% of new coronavirus infections in the US.

The CDC studied about 9100 people who became infected with COVID-19 in New York City between last November [2022] and January of this year [2023]. It found that the hospitalization ratio of people infected with XBB.1.5 was 7.3%, compared to 6.4% among those infected with the previously predominant BQ.1.

The study also found no significant difference in the percentage of deaths. The ratio was 0.8% for XBB.1.5 and 0.6% for BQ.1.

The CDC concluded that the preliminary findings do not suggest more severe disease among patients infected with XBB.1.5 compared with those infected with BQ.1.

[XBB.1.5 is currently responsible for about 90% of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the US, according to the US CDC. It is currently the only omicron SARS-CoV-2 subvariant showing significant growth in the US. <https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2023-03-03/cdc-omicron-subvariant-xbb-1-5-responsible-for-90-of-new-coronavirus-infections> - Mod.LWW]

[A] Iran: COVID deaths in Iran become double digit again
Date: Wed 1 Mar 2023
Source: Iran Front Page [edited]
<https://ifpnews.com/covid-deaths-iran-double-digit/>


Thirteen more Iranians have died from the coronavirus over the past 24 hours bringing the total number of deaths to 144 858, Iran's Health Ministry said on [Wed 1 Mar 2023]. A total of 997 new cases of infection with COVID-19 were found over the past 24 hours, 422 of whom were hospitalized, he added.

The Iranian Health Ministry noted that [7 339 457] patients out of a total of [7 568 903] infected people have recovered or been discharged from hospitals.

As many as 301 COVID-19 patients are in critical condition and in intensive care units, the report added.

The Iranian Health Ministry also announced that 65 203 494 Iranians have received the first dose and 58 598 023 people have so far received the 2nd dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Moreover, 31 643 214 people have also received the 3rd or 4th shots as the booster jab.

[It is unclear which SARS-CoV-2 variant is circulating in Iran, but it is reasonable to expect that they will be similar to variants currently circulating in surrounding countries and worldwide. These variants have significant ability to escape vaccine-induced immunity, and those who have received booster doses tend to be better protected against currently circulating variants. Official numbers reported indicate that only about 36% of Iranians have received one or 2 booster doses, and it is unclear which vaccines were predominantly used. More information is needed to assess whether the proportion of severe cases and the fatality rate is higher than usual.

[4] Protection against severe COVID-19 after a 2nd booster dose of the bivalent COVID-19 vaccine

Citation: Fabiani M, Mateo-Urdiales A, Sacco C, et al., on behalf of the Italian Integrated Surveillance of COVID-19 study group and of the Italian COVID-19 Vaccines Registry group. Protection against severe COVID-19 after a 2nd booster dose of adapted bivalent (original/omicron BA.4-5) mRNA vaccine in persons ≥ 60 years, by time since infection, Italy, 12 September to 11 December 2022. Eurosurveillance. 2023;28(8):pii=2300105. <https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2023.28.8.2300105>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background
----------
Given the high circulation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during the year 2022, characterised by predominance of the omicron variant, hybrid immunity conferred by vaccination and infection has become a frequent immunological status in the population, requiring a careful evaluation to refine indications on timing for the administration of a booster dose. Our aim was to evaluate, among persons ≥ 60 years, the effectiveness against severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) of a 2nd booster dose of the bivalent (original/BA.4-5) mRNA vaccine (BioNtech/Pfizer, Mainz, Germany/New York, United States (US)), relative to a first booster dose of a monovalent vaccine (Comirnaty (BNT162b2 mRNA, BioNtech/Pfizer) or Spikevax (mRNA-1273, Moderna, Cambridge, US) given at least 120 days earlier, according to the time elapsed since a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Methods
-------
We conducted a retrospective cohort study in Italy based on data from the national vaccination registry and the national COVID-19 surveillance system linked through the participants' individual tax code. The study was conducted during predominant circulation of the omicron BA.5 (Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak lineage (Pango) lineage B.1.1.529.5) subvariant (> 90%) [1]. It started on [12 Sep 2022] and ended on [11 Dec 2022]. We used data extracted from both sources on [11 Jan 2023] to account for an additional 28-day period to ascertain possible hospitalisation or death post-infection and 3 days of possible notification delay.

Findings
--------
We found that, among persons ≥ 60 years of age in Italy, the rVE of a 2nd booster dose of the adapted bivalent original/BA.4-5 mRNA vaccine in the time-interval 7-90 days post-administration, compared with a first booster dose of a monovalent mRNA vaccine received at least 120 days earlier, was 60% in those without a prior infection and in those with a prior infection occurring more than 6 months earlier (≥ 27 weeks). However, we did not observe an additional significant protective effect following the administration of the 2nd booster dose in those infected 4-6 months earlier (17-26 weeks). 

Conclusion
------------
The results of this study suggest that, for persons ≥ 60 years and with a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, a 2nd booster dose of the bivalent original/BA.4-5 mRNA vaccine 6 months after the latest infection might be warranted.

The Oshana region has been hit by a mumps outbreak.

The highly contagious disease, which is caused by a virus, was detected at Oshakati West Primary School in the region about 2 weeks ago.

Oshana health director Johanna Haimene yesterday [5 Mar 2023] said a team of healthcare officials will be dispatched to the school today to monitor the situation. Pupils attending the school have been urged to be cautious at all times.

""The outbreak was reported to my office on Friday [3 Mar 2023], however, I cannot divulge any information on the matter, because our health officers are yet to assess the situation at the school.

""We have not gathered any additional information as of yet. More details will be shared tomorrow [7 Mar 2023] after inspection at the school,"" Haimene said.

About 12 pupils are reportedly affected, and they were last week sent home to recover. Pupils' parents and guardians have been asked to provide the children with masks in an effort to minimise the further spread of the disease.

Haimene said the health directorate, together with the school, will be monitoring the situation until the outbreak has been contained, as mumps is highly contagious. The last suspected pumps outbreak in Namibia was reported in September 2022, when the Erongo regional health directorate issued a warning of a suspected outbreak in the Swakopmund district.

At the time, the chief medical officer of the Erongo region, Dr Leonard Kabongo, said 26 suspected cases were reported in the Swakopmund district as of 9-20 Sep 2022 at Swakopmund and 3 cases each at Arandis and Henties Bay. Kabongo at the time said symptoms of the virus typically appear 16-18 days after infection.

According to a nonprofit academic medical centre, Mayo Clinic, mumps usually affects the glands on each side of the face. Symptoms may be similar to flu, including fever, headache, muscle aches, a loss of appetite, and tiredness.

The disease is spread through saliva, coughing, and sneezing, as well as through touching surfaces where droplets have landed, touching the face, or direct contact, such as kissing.

[Mumps virus, scientific name _Mumps orthorubulavirus_, is in the family Paramyxoviridae. The virus usually affects the parotid glands, which swell within a few days of infection, causing pain or tenderness around the swelling. The disease, mumps, can be prevented by the mumps vaccine, which is a part of the recommended childhood vaccinations. It's usually given as a combined measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. The schedule is: the 1st dose between the ages of 12 and 15 months; the 2nd dose between the ages of 4 and 6 years, before entering school.

Another version of MMR includes the vaccine against the virus that causes chickenpox, (varicella-zoster virus). But that vaccine, called the measles-mumps-rubella-varicella vaccine (MMRV) is not used for the 1st dose in the standard vaccination schedule for children.

Infection is generally mild but unvaccinated individuals may suffer complications of infection, including swollen testicles (orchitis); swollen ovaries (oophoritis); encephalitis; meningitis; hearing loss (hearing usually gets better after the illness); pancreatitis; miscarriage (especially during the 1st 12 weeks of pregnancy)

Two cases of measles were detected in Ukraine. Ukrainians were reminded how to protect themselves. This is reported by RBC-Ukraine with reference to the Ministry of Health.

""Both children are from the same family, one of them previously received the 1st dose of vaccination, the other was not vaccinated,"" the message reads.

Currently, according to the Ministry of Health, the children are being provided with the necessary medical care, those who came in contact with them were subjected to a PCR test to detect measles, and the results were negative.

In order to protect against measles, 2 doses of the vaccine must be given.

""If your child is over 6 months old, if there are epidemic indications, you can administer a zero dose of the vaccine, which is not counted as the 1st dose of vaccination,"" added the Ministry of Health.

[It is difficult to imagine how Ukraine can maintain a vaccination program with the ongoing conflict with Russia. The situation is dire with little hope for a resolution soon. Sadly, it is always the children who suffer the most, but because living conditions are so difficult for everyone, the whole population is at risk.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
""Ukraine has a history of large outbreaks, and experts say that the disruptions brought by Russia's invasion could trigger new cases. Ed Holt reports.

""Measles vaccine coverage rates in Ukraine have dipped sharply since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of the country on 24 Feb 2022, raising fears of a large outbreak. Measles is endemic in Ukraine, and there have been two major outbreaks in the past decade. In 2017-19, more than 115 000 people were infected and 41 died. Most infections were among those who were either unvaccinated or whose vaccination status was undetermined.

""At the start of the 2017-19 outbreak, national vaccination coverage was 42% -- well below the 95% that WHO says is needed for herd immunity -- due to a mixture of strong vaccine hesitancy and shortages of the vaccine. Following the outbreak, intensive efforts by Ukrainian health authorities to encourage vaccination pushed coverage up to 88% in 2021. But last year [2022] it fell to 74%.

""Last month [February 2023], WHO warned of the risks of disease outbreaks in the country, and with such low vaccine coverage, some healthcare experts fear a major outbreak is not far off. Pavlo Kovtoniuk was Deputy Health Minister of Ukraine at the time of the outbreak and is now head of the Ukrainian Healthcare Centre, a Kyiv-based non-governmental organisation. ""I remember what it was like then and I can see it happening again, maybe not immediately, but within a year"", he told The Lancet.

""Experts say mass population displacement due to the Russian invasion -- the UN estimates that there are at least 6 million internally displaced people (IDPs) in Ukraine now -- has affected coverage, with many IDPs missing vaccinations. ""Some have lost all their documents and do not want to start vaccination again or do not have the money for tests to check their immunity to measles"", said Professor Alla Volokha, Head of the Paediatric Infectious Diseases and Paediatric Immunology Department at Shupyk National Healthcare University of Ukraine. ""Registering with local doctors also may not be on top of their list of priorities"", she said, adding that others might be reluctant to give personal details over fears of possible army conscription.

""Many IDPs living in crowded accommodations and are often already in weakened health after their ordeal or because of pre-existing illness. ""Measles is one of the most contagious diseases and 9 out of 10 unimmune persons will get infected upon contact with a sick person. The higher the number of vulnerable individuals there are in a community, the higher an individual's risk will be of contracting the disease. The risk of developing severe or fatal measles increases for children aged under 5 [years], persons living in overcrowded conditions, those who are malnourished, and those with immunological disorders, such as AIDS"", Jarno Habicht, WHO Representative in Ukraine, told The Lancet.

""The health system was already under severe pressure following the COVID-19 pandemic; it has since had to cope with clinics and hospitals being targeted by Russian troops and frequent power outages. ""Everyone is doing their best, but disease surveillance may not be as high as it was pre-war"", Siddhartha Sankar Datta, Regional Adviser for Vaccine-preventable Diseases and Immunization at WHO, told The Lancet. ""If we don't know very quickly where cases are, then if there is a case out there, [the disease] could spread like wildfire.""

""Ukrainian health authorities are working to improve vaccination coverage. The health ministry has prioritised immunisation programmes and, in cooperation with organisations such as UNICEF and WHO, has ensured supply and safe storage of vaccines, as well as delivery to areas without accessible healthcare facilities through mobile vaccination teams. Outreach services have also been set up to encourage people to get vaccinated.

""Last year [2022], 11 measles cases were recorded in the country. Ironically, the low number is thought to be largely due to the war, as schools have closed and teaching has moved mainly online, while large public events have not been held. There have been no cases reported yet this year [2023], and Datta said that while a repeat of the 2017-19 outbreak was possible, he was optimistic it could be avoided through a strong vaccination catch-up campaign this year.

""But others believe it is only a matter of time before a large outbreak occurs. Professor Andrii Loboda of the Department of Paediatrics at Sumy State University in Ukraine said one could come as soon as this year as, despite ongoing fighting, a degree of stability was returning to society which would eventually lead to children meeting again in classrooms and others returning to the country from abroad.

""He also warned that any outbreak ""could be more severe than the last one"". ""In the 2017-2019 outbreak, 65-67% of the affected were children and 33-35% were adults...but now we have a new risk group among adults -- our military forces. Our soldiers are suffering from cold, rain, respiratory infections, and stress that predisposes to a lack of immunity; crowds of soldiers and insufficient infection control on the front line of military operations could prompt the rapid spread of measles.""

A person in their late 20s is in isolation in hospital in Launceston as they become Tasmania's 1st measles case since 2019. The patient had recently returned from overseas travel.

This was released by Public Health: Measles is a highly infectious illness that is rare in Australia. Cases and small outbreaks occasionally occur and are usually associated with overseas travel. People who have had 2 doses of the measles vaccine or were born before 1966 are generally protected against catching measles. The case is now in isolation at the Launceston General Hospital. Contact tracing is underway to identify people who may have been exposed to the case while they were infectious.

[See URL above for details on where the case spent time while infectious. - Mod.LK]

People who were present at the locations [noted in the URL] during the times listed and have not received 2 measles-containing vaccines are urged to be alert for measles symptoms for up to 18 days following their exposure. Public Health advises that these locations do not pose an ongoing risk to the public, the risk only remains for up to 30 minutes after the case has left each location. People at risk of measles infection include those born during or after 1966 who have not been fully vaccinated against measles, are immunocompromised, or have not had a previous measles infection. Measles is vaccine-preventable and those who have received 2 doses of a measles-containing vaccine have a high level of protection against measles. If symptoms develop, individuals are advised to isolate, contact the Public Health Hotline, and if they need medical attention, they should call ahead and advise of their concerns of measles to prevent further spread.

2 doses of a measles-containing vaccine provide a high level of protection against measles. The measles vaccine is recommended for all children at 12 months and 18 months of age. Vaccines are available through GPs, council clinics, and community health centres. Under the National Immunisation Program, the vaccine is free for children aged 12 and 18 months. The measles vaccine is also available from pharmacies for eligible people aged 16 years and older. Under a state-funded program, the measles vaccine is also free for
- Tasmanians born during or after 1966 who do not have documented evidence of receiving 2 measles-containing vaccines or serological (blood test) evidence of immunity.
-  Infants aged 6-12 months who are travelling overseas.

Most people born before 1966 are considered immune to measles because they are likely to have had the infection as children.

[""Tasmania is an island state of Australia. It is located 240 km (150 mi) to the south of the Australian mainland, separated from it by the Bass Strait, with the archipelago containing the southernmost point of the country. The state encompasses the main island of Tasmania, the 26th-largest island in the world, and the surrounding 1000 islands. It is Australia's least populous state, with 569 825 residents as of December 2021.""
(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmania>)

This is yet another case of travel-related measles. This disease is rare in Australia and cases are generally travel-related. It is important to maintain vaccination even in countries where measles is not recognized as a major problem because of the possibility of travel-related transmission. Measles is one of the most infectious viruses known, thus easily spread. - Mod.LK

CDC: 'Undetermined number of these people may have been exposed  to measles at Asbury University

In a follow-up on the confirmed case of measles in an unvaccinated individual who attended a large spiritual revival on Asbury University's campus in Wilmore, Kentucky on 18 Feb 2023, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a health advisory [see ProMED Measles update (11): Ghana, South Africa, India, USA 20230227.8708629].

Officials say an estimated 20 000 people attended the gathering from Kentucky, other US states, and other countries during 17-18 Feb 2023, and an undetermined number of these people may have been exposed.

CDC offered the following recommendations for the public (including children) and those who attended the gathering:
- If you attended the Asbury University gathering on 17 or 18 Feb 2023 and you are unvaccinated or not fully vaccinated against measles, you should quarantine for 21 days after your last exposure and monitor yourself for symptoms of measles so that you do not spread measles to others.
- If you attended the gathering and are not up to date on your measles vaccinations, talk to your healthcare provider right away about getting vaccinated after completing your quarantine.
- If you think that you have measles or have been exposed to someone with measles, isolate yourself from others and call your healthcare provider, urgent care, or emergency room before arriving to be tested. Do not arrive at a healthcare facility without giving advance notice.
- Measles is extremely contagious and can cause life-threatening illness. Anyone who is not protected against measles is at risk. An unvaccinated person can get measles when traveling abroad or in the US.

2 doses of MMR vaccine provide better protection against measles than one dose.

Two new cases of Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE) virus infection and one death have been confirmed in Victoria. One case was identified in a woman in her 60s who died in late February 2023 [see Murray Valley encephalitis - Australia (02): (VI) 20230218.8708465], and the other is a man in his 70s who is receiving treatment in hospital. Both were likely exposed to infected mosquitoes in northern Victoria.

The risk of mosquito-borne diseases such as Japanese encephalitis (JE), MVE, and West Nile (Kunjin) virus infections is high this season, particularly in northern Victoria where viruses are being detected in mosquitoes.

A total of 3 cases of MVE virus infection and 2 deaths have been reported in Victoria this mosquito season.

MVE is a rare but potentially serious infection of the brain spread to humans by infected mosquitoes. There is no vaccine for MVE, the best prevention is to protect yourself against mosquito bites.

East Java Governor Khofifah Indar Parawansa said that an outbreak of leptospirosis or a disease caused by rat urine had been detected in several areas in East Java. Because of this, Khofifah asked residents to increase their vigilance and continue to improve their clean and healthy lifestyles in the rainy season.

Based on data from the East Java Provincial Health Office, there were 606 cases of leptospirosis in 2022. This year, as of 5 Mar 2023, 249 cases have been recorded with 9 deaths. Of the total 249 cases, most were in Pacitan, namely 204 cases with 6 deaths.

In addition, in Probolinggo Regency 3 cases and 2 deaths, Gresik 3 cases, Lumajang 8 cases, Probolinggo City 5 cases and 1 death, Sampang 22 cases, and Tulungagung 4 cases. Leptospirosis is caused by _Leptospira_ bacteria.

The disease spreads through the urine of animals infected with leptospira bacteria and contaminates the environment, especially in environments where there is stagnant water and contact with injured skin. ""Animals infected with this bacterium do not die, but in humans, it can cause death,"" the governor explained. The disease is also spread through water or soil that has been contaminated with the urine of infected animals. Animals carrying the _Leptospira_ bacteria include rats, cows, pigs, and other animals, but rats are the primary source.

Cases of leptospirosis in Pacitan, East Java Province, continue to grow. Data from the local district health office, the total number per day has reached 126 people. Of these, 18 people are still undergoing medical treatment at several health facilities.

The largest number of patients undergoing medical treatment were at the Ngadirojo District Health Center, namely 14 patients. Of these, 6 of them were hospitalized, while the rest were outpatients. [Ngadirojo is one of the districts in Pacitran Regency, East Java Province, Indonesia.] For the past few days, patients with leptospirosis have been treated at this puskesmas [Community Health Centre]. On average, each patient undergoes treatment between 3 and 4 days, depending on their condition.

Apart from the Ngadirojo Health Center, several leptospirosis patients also underwent medical treatment, including 3 people at the Tulakan Health Center, and one patient at the Bubakan Health Center. [Tulakan is one of the districts in Pacitan Regency. Bubakan is also located in East Java.]

The Acting Head of the Pacitan District Health Office, Daru Mustiko Aji, said that so far 6 people have died from the disease. However, of that number, 3 were due to co-morbidities, such as heart disease and dengue fever. ""108 people have been declared cured,"" explained Daru Mustiko Aji in his interview with Metro TV.

Spread by blood, leptospirosis disease is endemic in Pacitan district, and spreads to 9 districts. The high rainfall and the large population of rats are thought to be the cause of the _Leptospira_ bacteria spreading everywhere. Various efforts to prevent it from spreading continue to be carried out, including providing socialization to the community and reducing rat populations in rice fields. Internal Medicine Specialist Consultant for Tropical and Infectious Diseases from the Metropolitan Medical Center Hospital, Erni Juwita Nelwan, in an interview with Media Indonesia some time ago, explained that leptospirosis is a disease that can be transmitted from animals such as mice to humans. _Leptospira_ bacteria live in the kidneys of animals, contaminate the animal's urine and enter the human body through open pores and mucous membranes due to wounds, for example.

""This disease can affect anyone, depending on their occupation. The highest risk factors are farmers and workers who have direct contact with rice fields or ditches,"" said Erni. Most people do not realize that they have leptospirosis. This is because the period for [leptospirosis] to cause symptoms lasts from 2 weeks to one month. ""In fact, this disease can be very deadly. It can also be like a heart attack. The symptoms are in all organs because the bacteria spread through the blood. If you are in a flooded area, you must always tell the doctor,"" said Erni. To prevent leptospirosis from occurring, Erni appealed to the public to adopt a clean and healthy lifestyle. In addition, you must get used to wearing protective equipment when in direct contact with floods and ditches. ""People who have to be in direct contact can prevent [leptospirosis] by taking the antibiotic doxycycline. Prevention with protective equipment, closed clothes, and wearing boots is better,"" he explained.

However, of that number, 3 were due to co-morbidities, such as heart disease and dengue fever. ""108 people have been declared cured,"" explained Daru Mustiko Aji in his interview with Metro TV.Spread by blood, leptospirosis disease is endemic in Pacitan district, and spreads to 9 districts. The high rainfall and the large population of rats are thought to be the cause of the _Leptospira_ bacteria spreading everywhere. Various efforts to prevent it from spreading continue to be carried out, including providing socialization to the community and reducing rat populations in rice fields. Internal Medicine Specialist Consultant for Tropical and Infectious Diseases from the Metropolitan Medical Center Hospital, Erni Juwita Nelwan, in an interview with Media Indonesia some time ago, explained that leptospirosis is a disease that can be transmitted from animals such as mice to humans. _Leptospira_ bacteria live in the kidneys of animals, contaminate the animal's urine and enter the human body through open pores and mucous membranes due to wounds, for example.""This disease can affect anyone, depending on their occupation. The highest risk factors are farmers and workers who have direct contact with rice fields or ditches,"" said Erni. Most people do not realize that they have leptospirosis. This is because the period for [leptospirosis] to cause symptoms lasts from 2 weeks to one month. ""In fact, this disease can be very deadly. It can also be like a heart attack. The symptoms are in all organs because the bacteria spread through the blood. If you are in a flooded area, you must always tell the doctor,"" said Erni. To prevent leptospirosis from occurring, Erni appealed to the public to adopt a clean and healthy lifestyle. In addition, you must get used to wearing protective equipment when in direct contact with floods and ditches. ""People who have to be in direct contact can prevent [leptospirosis] by taking the antibiotic doxycycline. Prevention with protective equipment, closed clothes, and wearing boots is better,"" he explained.[Byline: Achmad Faizal, editor: Andi Haritik]--Communicated by:ProMED[ProMED posted a 28 Feb 2023 report of a leptospirosis outbreak of 112 cases in 5 of the 9 villages in the Nawangan District, which is one of the 12 districts in Pacitan Regency, East Java Province, Indonesia (ProMED post Leptospirosis - Indonesia: (JI) fatal 20230301.8708668).

The number of scabies cases in the Netherlands is rising again and is currently at its highest point since it peaked in early December [2022], according to research institute Nivel. The institute reported a striking number of infections among 0 to 4-year-olds in Overijssel.

Currently, 42 out of 100 000 Netherlands residents have scabies. At the beginning of December 2022, the number of infections was 44 out of 100 000. ""We may still exceed that number, but it is difficult to predict,"" Nivel researcher Mariette Hooiveld said to NU.nl.

The number of people with this itchy skin condition is much higher than this time last year [2022] when 17 per 100 000 people had scabies. In the years before, the number fluctuated around 10.

The most recent increase showed a striking number of patients in the age group 0 to 4 years. Scabies is usually most common among people aged 15 to 24. According to Hooiveld, this increase among toddlers can be explained by an outbreak in Overijssel. She thinks a young child contracted scabies and spread it at daycare. There was also an increase in adults with scabies in the province.

Scabies is a skin infection caused by scabies mites. The tiny critters dig tunnels on the skin's surface and lay eggs, causing an intensely itchy rash. The number of scabies infections in the Netherlands has been rising since October 2021.

[Outbreaks of scabies can occur anywhere that people are in close quarters with frequent skin contact, such as hospitals, nursing homes, refugee centers, and prisons. Outbreaks among toddlers in daycare centers, however, are relatively rare (refs 1-3). A comprehensive review of 84 institutional scabies outbreaks from 1983-2013 found that outbreaks most frequently occurred in hospitals and nursing homes, and persisted for an average of 3 months (ref 4). Most index cases had crusted scabies, and scabies was frequently misdiagnosed. Oral ivermectin or 5% permethrin are now preferred over 1% lindane for treating scabies. The frequency of institutional scabies outbreaks has not diminished over time, and indeed, in many countries (such as the Netherlands), the number of scabies cases has been rising. Early and accurate diagnosis, surveillance, and infection control are the keys to preventing and limiting scabies outbreaks in institutional settings.

After 10% of the dog population at the Palm Valley Animal Society tested positive for distemper, officials say the outbreak of the highly contagious virus is over.

""We were able to identify some animals not having distemper to get some to foster and some out to rescue,"" shelter director of operations Faith Wright said. ""Unfortunately, some we were not able to save if they were so sick.""

Wright said they were only able to save about 20 of the sick dogs. The rest had to be put down because there was not enough space at the shelter to isolate them for treatment.

""In a shelter like this, we don't have large-scale isolation units, we do have to worry about the rapid spread,"" Wright said. ""You're talking about trying to treat an animal for 30 to 45 days in a shelter setting and not have any cross-exposure with other animals, which is very hard.""

The virus entered the shelter through an infected stray, and Wright said there are more cases out there. ""We are seeing a lot of animals coming in from the community having it,"" Wright said.

Dog owners are aware of the problem. Sofia Salas said she keeps her dog who is a rescue, vaccinated. ""I do see a lot of dogs out there not with owners, just walking around hungry and stuff, and it does look like it's a big issue in the Valley,"" Salas said. ""So I keep her vaccinated since she was 3 weeks old when I found her.""

It's those same vaccinations that the shelter encourages owners to get for their pets. ""Distemper is highly contagious for dogs, they need to be fully vaccinated,"" Wright said. ""And if they're not fully vaccinated, they run the risk of getting distemper from each other,"" Wright said.

[""Canine distemper is a contagious and serious disease caused by a virus that attacks the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and nervous systems of puppies and dogs.

""The virus can also be found in wildlife such as foxes, wolves, coyotes, raccoons, skunks, mink, and ferrets and has been reported in lions, tigers, leopards, and other wild cats as well as seals.

""How is canine distemper spread?
""Puppies and dogs most often become infected through airborne exposure (through sneezing or coughing) to the virus from an infected dog or wild animal. The virus can also be transmitted by shared food and water bowls and equipment. Infected dogs can shed the virus for months, and mother dogs can pass the virus through the placenta to their puppies.

""Because canine distemper also impacts wildlife populations, contact between wild animals and domestic dogs can facilitate the spread of the virus. Canine distemper outbreaks in local raccoon populations can signal an increased risk for pet dogs in the area.

""What dogs are at risk?
All dogs are at risk but puppies younger than 4 months old and dogs not vaccinated against canine distemper are at increased risk of acquiring the disease.

""What are the signs of canine distemper?
Initially, infected dogs will develop watery to pus-like discharge from their eyes. They then develop fever, nasal discharge, coughing, lethargy, reduced appetite, and vomiting. As the virus attacks the nervous system, infected dogs develop circling behavior, head tilt, muscle twitches, convulsions with jaw chewing movements and salivation (""chewing gum fits""), seizures, and partial or complete paralysis. The virus may also cause the footpads to thicken and harden, leading to its nickname ""hard pad disease.""

""In wildlife, infection with canine distemper closely resembles rabies.

""Distemper is often fatal, and dogs surviving usually have permanent, irreparable nervous system damage.

""How is canine distemper diagnosed and treated?
""Veterinarians diagnose canine distemper through clinical appearance and laboratory testing. There is no cure for canine distemper infection. Treatment typically consists of supportive care and efforts to prevent 2ary infections; control vomiting, diarrhea, and neurologic symptoms; and combat dehydration through the administration of fluids. Dogs infected with canine distemper must be separated from other dogs to minimize the risk of further infection.

""How is canine distemper prevented?
""Vaccination is crucial in preventing canine distemper.
- A series of vaccinations are administered to puppies to increase the likelihood of building immunity when the immune system has not yet fully matured.
- Avoid gaps in the immunization schedule and make sure distemper vaccinations are up to date.
- Avoid contact with infected animals and wildlife
- Use caution when socializing puppies or unvaccinated dogs at parks, puppy classes, obedience classes, doggy daycare, and other places where dogs can congregate.
- Pet ferrets should be vaccinated against canine distemper using a USDA-approved ferret vaccine."" 
Extracted from: AVMA Canine Distemper <https://www.avma.org/resources/pet-owners/petcare/canine-distemper>

Generally, puppies need to have a series of 3 shots, about every 3 weeks beginning at 6 weeks of age. The size and health of the puppy may necessitate shifting the usual schedule. Your veterinarian should be a partner in keeping your pet healthy. - Mod.TG]

After having zero foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) cases at the end of 2022, yesterday [Sat 4 Mar 2023], cases of FMD in Cirebon Regency are now reappearing.

Data from the Cirebon Regency (Distan) Agriculture Department as of [27 Feb 2023], out of a total of 1885 ruminants, 26 died, 186 were forcibly slaughtered, 1,632 recovered and 41 are still sick.

Cirebon Distan District Secretary Dr. Encus Suswaningsih said FMD cases as of early 2023 were spread across 80 villages in 32 sub-districts.

According to Encus, FMD cases reappeared in Cirebon Regency as supplies of ruminants arrived from outside Cirebon Regency before the Islamic holidays. ""In preparation for the qurbani festival, entrepreneurs have even started buying them now,"" Encus Suswaningsih said on [Sun 25 Mar 2023].

So far, Encus said, there are still 41 ruminants affected by FMD. They are spread across 9 villages in a number of sub-districts.

It adds the following details: ""At the end of last year (2022), the handling of FMD cases in this area (Cirebon Regency]) was considered very good. Of the 1783 ruminants infected with FMD in 30 sub-districts and 69 villages, at that time only 3 were left which were still in the healing stage. Of these, 1000 animals have been declared cured. So, it is estimated that in the near future Cirebon Regency will have zero FMD cases"". 

Indonesia's Ministry of Agriculture operates a website dedicated to the continuing FMD epizootic. The website presents (daily) updates on the course of the disease (number and locations of currently active cases, total confirmed cases, recovered, deaths, slaughtered) and of the vaccination performance.

More animals have been detected with the H5N1 avian flu, the US Department of Agriculture reports.

The department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, which maintains a list of detections of avian flu in mammals, has recently added 10 new cases from 4 states and including 5 species.

To date, 208 million birds worldwide have been affected by a massive outbreak of avian flu, which is spilling over to mammals.

Human infections have been rare and have occurred in people who had close contact with poultry, according to the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy. Of the handful of cases that have been reported, some were severe or fatal, with others thought to represent environmental contamination rather than true infections.

In Colorado, inspectors found the virus in 3 mountain lions, a bobcat, 2 red foxes, and a black bear. Elsewhere, striped skunks were detected in Kansas and Oregon. And North Carolina reported a black bear.

""There are many species that are potentially susceptible to HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza]. In addition to birds and poultry, H5N1 viruses have been detected in some mammals (see list below),"" the government says. ""Infection may cause illness, including severe disease and death in some cases.""

The government says 131 cases have been reported of known detections of the H5N1 avian flu in animals.

""Health officials are closely monitoring continuing reports of H5N1 spillovers to mammals, which have been reported from the Americas and Europe,"" reported the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. ""The Eurasian H5N1 clade currently hitting birds and poultry in multiple world regions has a mutation that makes it more recognizable to mammal airway cells, including humans.""

The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) has identified new areas in which people should be particularly wary of tick bites. In Bavaria and Saxony-Anhalt, it expanded the risk areas for tick-borne encephalitis [TBE].

The districts of Anhalt-Bitterfeld and Fürstenfeldbruck as well as the urban district of Munich have been added, as the RKI reports in a current report. This means that almost 180 districts nationwide are now designated as risk areas.

Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg as risk areas
-------------------------------------------
The classification of risk areas is based on data on reported TBE diseases from 2002 to 2022. According to the RKI, there is a risk of infection above all in Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg, in southern Hesse, in south-eastern Thuringia, in Saxony, and since the previous year, also in south-eastern Brandenburg. There are also individual risk areas in other federal states. According to the RKI, there are also isolated infections outside of designated risk areas.

According to the RKI report, 546 TBE diseases were reported in 2022, 30 percent more than in the previous year [2021]. A small proportion of those affected was probably infected abroad. The number of cases recorded has fluctuated greatly between 195 (2012) and 717 (2020) since 2001. In 2022, 2 deaths were recorded in this connection.

Vaccinations protect against encephalitis
-----------------------------------------
The majority of infections with the virus are symptomless. The risk of serious illness is significantly increased in people over 60 years of age. The Standing Vaccination Commission (STIKO) recommends a TBE vaccination for people who live, work, or stay there for other reasons in TBE risk areas and are therefore at risk of tick bites.

The vast majority, namely 98 percent of the TBE patients reported in 2022, were not or insufficiently vaccinated against TBE, writes the RKI. Vaccination rates are also low in risk areas. A high proportion of cases are therefore considered avoidable.

If the virus multiplies in the brain and spinal cord, severe courses with permanent neurological deficits can occur. Possible consequences include permanent paralysis and swallowing and speech disorders.

Tick-proof clothing only offers limited protection
---------------------------------------------
According to the RKI report, tick bites can be prevented in part by protective measures such as wearing closed clothing, avoiding undergrowth and tall grass, and staying on fixed paths.

However, the most reliable protection is offered by the TBE vaccination. Since TBE viruses get into humans as soon as they start sucking, ticks have to be removed immediately and the wound disinfected. Searching the body later and pulling out ticks protect little.

[The issuance of this warning is timely because the season for active _Ixodes ricinus_ tick, the tick-borne encephalitis vector in Europe, is soon approaching. Usually, the _I. ricinus_ activity in Germany starts mid- to end of March. The report above indicates that areas of tick abundance and risk of TBE are expanding. The coming situation of the tick activity and prevalence of the TBE virus in the ticks will now be monitored continuously during the year to predict an increasing risk of infection in the known TBE foci. TBE virus infections can be serious. The advice above for individuals in areas of risk to avoid tick bites and, especially, be vaccinated is prudent. A vaccine is available and is recommended for individuals who visit or work in forested areas where ticks are abundant.

Tick-borne encephalitis is a virus infection caused by one of 3 TBE virus subtypes belonging to the Flaviviridae family: Central European, Siberian, and Far Eastern (formerly known as Russian spring-summer encephalitis). It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected _Ixodes_ ticks. - Mod.TY

This means that almost 180 districts nationwide are now designated as risk areas.Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg as risk areas-------------------------------------------The classification of risk areas is based on data on reported TBE diseases from 2002 to 2022. According to the RKI, there is a risk of infection above all in Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg, in southern Hesse, in south-eastern Thuringia, in Saxony, and since the previous year, also in south-eastern Brandenburg. There are also individual risk areas in other federal states. According to the RKI, there are also isolated infections outside of designated risk areas.According to the RKI report, 546 TBE diseases were reported in 2022, 30 percent more than in the previous year [2021]. A small proportion of those affected was probably infected abroad. The number of cases recorded has fluctuated greatly between 195 (2012) and 717 (2020) since 2001. In 2022, 2 deaths were recorded in this connection.Vaccinations protect against encephalitis-----------------------------------------The majority of infections with the virus are symptomless. The risk of serious illness is significantly increased in people over 60 years of age. The Standing Vaccination Commission (STIKO) recommends a TBE vaccination for people who live, work, or stay there for other reasons in TBE risk areas and are therefore at risk of tick bites.The vast majority, namely 98 percent of the TBE patients reported in 2022, were not or insufficiently vaccinated against TBE, writes the RKI. Vaccination rates are also low in risk areas. A high proportion of cases are therefore considered avoidable.If the virus multiplies in the brain and spinal cord, severe courses with permanent neurological deficits can occur. Possible consequences include permanent paralysis and swallowing and speech disorders.Tick-proof clothing only offers limited protection---------------------------------------------According to the RKI report, tick bites can be prevented in part by protective measures such as wearing closed clothing, avoiding undergrowth and tall grass, and staying on fixed paths.However, the most reliable protection is offered by the TBE vaccination. Since TBE viruses get into humans as soon as they start sucking, ticks have to be removed immediately and the wound disinfected. Searching the body later and pulling out ticks protect little.--Communicated by:ProMED[The issuance of this warning is timely because the season for active _Ixodes ricinus_ tick, the tick-borne encephalitis vector in Europe, is soon approaching. Usually, the _I. ricinus_ activity in Germany starts mid- to end of March. The report above indicates that areas of tick abundance and risk of TBE are expanding. The coming situation of the tick activity and prevalence of the TBE virus in the ticks will now be monitored continuously during the year to predict an increasing risk of infection in the known TBE foci. TBE virus infections can be serious. The advice above for individuals in areas of risk to avoid tick bites and, especially, be vaccinated is prudent. A vaccine is available and is recommended for individuals who visit or work in forested areas where ticks are abundant.Tick-borne encephalitis is a virus infection caused by one of 3 TBE virus subtypes belonging to the Flaviviridae family: Central European, Siberian, and Far Eastern (formerly known as Russian spring-summer encephalitis). It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected _Ixodes_ ticks. - Mod.TYProMED map:Germany: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8708766,101>]",Globe Echo,,

Marssonina blotch of apple, a relative newcomer to Pennsylvania, is increasing in orchards. It is much more aggressive than apple scab [see comment below]. In heavy infestations the fungus can spread to fruit, but the main problem is that it causes rapid defoliation, giving a tree the appearance of winter before the fruit has even been harvested.

It has been reported as spreading in the region since 2017. It was not clear if the disease would cause problems, given that many fungicides are effective against it. But as marssonina has become established, certain apple varieties were found to be particularly vulnerable.

Control depends on defeating the initial burst of spores in spring or the fungus will reinfect multiple times. Broad spectrum, as well as Group 3 [DMI] and 7 [SDHI] fungicides work best; group 11 [strobilurin] fungicides are less effective. Sanitation is another key part of control. Growers should get rid of leaf litter. Some of the scab-resistant varieties are among the most susceptible to marssonina.

[Marssonina blotch (MB) of apple is caused by the fungus _Diplocarpon mali_ (previously _Marssonina coronariae_). It has been found in some countries in the Americas, Asia, and Europe. Infections first appear on mature leaves. Symptoms may include spots on leaves and fruit as well as severe premature leaf fall. In affected orchards, apples nearing maturity are often seen hanging from defoliated branches. MB affects size, colour, and quality of fruit, making the produce unsaleable. It also reduces fruit set in the following season.

The fungus is reported to survive between seasons in fallen leaf litter; spores are spread by mechanical means and wind. MB development is favoured by humid conditions. Multiple cycles of infection may occur in one crop leading to severe epidemics. Disease management includes phytosanitary measures, cultural techniques, and fungicides. MB has been extending its range (e.g., in Europe, see ProMED post 20130927.1970792) as another example of a plant disease benefitting from a warming climate.

Apple scab (or black spot), also mentioned above, is caused by the fungus _Venturia inaequalis_ and is considered the most economically important disease of apples worldwide. For more information, see previous ProMED posts in the archives.

FRAC (Fungicide Resistance Action Committee) groups designate different modes of action of available fungicides (see links below).

A total of 25 pupils at St Andrews Primary School in Nuu ward in Mwingi Central Constituency in Kitui County have been admitted at Mwingi Level 4 hospital in critical condition after consuming maize meal made from suspected expired flour at the institution. Area Public Health Chief Officer Lynne Kitwan on Friday [3 Mar 2023] led a team of health officers to the school and upon undertaking an inspection, confiscated over 700 kilograms [about 1543 lb] of expired maize flour, which the health team linked to the illness of the 25 school children. The confiscated maize flour is currently under the custody of the Nuu police station, as the public health officers embark on an investigation of the suspected food poisoning.

Kitwan when speaking to the media lamented over the feeding of expired food supplies to the pupils at a private primary school institution, and wondered about the presence of the expired maize flour supplies at the school's store. ""It is a sad occurrence, a sad affair that had happened in a private school. It is sad because parents and guardians of these pupils pay a lot of money so that their children can have the best education, care, food, and security in private institutions like this one,"" said Kitwan.

The health officer noted that the 25 pupils were rushed to the hospital while in critical condition, but doctors stabilized their condition. Upon admission at Mwingi level 4 hospital, they were placed in an isolation ward. Kitwan said that 55 pupils from the school developed health complications, complaining of abdominal pains, diarrhea, and vomiting after consuming the suspected maize flour. They were rushed to the nearby Nuu health center before the 25 pupils who were seriously sick were referred to Mwingi Level 4 hospital while the other 30 were discharged after receiving treatment at the health center.

Kitwan and her team of health officers have ordered the immediate closure of the institution to allow the health investigation of the suspected food poisoning at the school. ""What we have discovered in our initial investigation is that this school is not up to standard on the feeding of the pupils. This facility has to be closed with immediate effect awaiting further investigations and will be opened once all recommendations are met in line with public health and sanitation regulations,"" she remarked.

The County Chief Officer of Medical Services, Dr Ben Wambua while commenting on the incident expressed regret that it is a shame for the school to alter the expiry date on maize flour packages. ""It is a shame that the school interfered with the expiry date on the maize flour. We cannot be feeding our pupils expired products,"" said Wambua.

Director of Health Administrative Services Francis Musyoka, Deputy Director Public Health Faith Mutinda, Sub-County MOH Mwingi Central Dr Evans Mumo, and Assistant County Commissioner (ACC) Nuu Division Mr Joel Laisuta were among local leaders who rushed to the school and were also present during the health inspection of the facility.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
_Cronobacter sakazakii_, a species of Gram-negative bacteria belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family, is known to cause severe and often fatal meningitis and sepsis in young infants. _C. sakazakii_ is ubiquitous in the environment, and most reported infant cases have been attributed to contaminated powdered infant formula (powdered formula) or breast milk that was expressed using contaminated breast pump equipment (1-3). Previous investigations of cases and outbreaks have identified _C. sakazakii_ in opened powdered formula, breast pump parts, environmental surfaces in the home, and, rarely, in unopened powdered formula and formula manufacturing facilities (2,4-6). This report describes 2 infants with _C. sakazakii_ meningitis reported to CDC in September 2021 and February 2022. CDC used whole genome sequencing (WGS) analysis to link one case to contaminated opened powdered formula from the patient's home and the other to contaminated breast pump equipment. These cases highlight the importance of expanding awareness about _C. sakazakii_ infections in infants, safe preparation and storage of powdered formula, proper cleaning and sanitizing of breast pump equipment, and using WGS as a tool for _C. sakazakii_ investigations.

In September 2021, a state public health department reported an infant with _C. sakazakii_ infection to CDC (patient A). In February 2022, a physician reported another case to CDC and a different state health department (patient B). CDC was invited to participate in the investigations and distributed case report forms to obtain detailed feeding information about the 2 cases. Patient isolates and environmental samples were sent to CDC, state public health laboratories, and other federal agencies for isolation, identification, and WGS analysis of _C. sakazakii_.

The 1st case occurred in September 2021 in a full-term (gestation of 40 weeks, 1 day) male infant (patient A) born to a healthy mother who had an uncomplicated pregnancy and spontaneous vaginal delivery. At age 14 days, the infant was evaluated at hospital A for fever, irritability, excessive crying, oral candidiasis (thrush), and diaper dermatitis. Before his illness, he was fed both expressed breast milk and powdered formula. A lumbar puncture was performed, and _C. sakazakii_ was isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The infant was admitted to the hospital and treated with intravenous antimicrobials for 21 days; he made a full recovery with no apparent long-term sequelae (Table [Table and Figure, available at the source URL above.])

A _C. sakazakii_ isolate from the CSF was analyzed by WGS. Samples of opened powdered formula and an opened bottled water container used for formula preparation in the patient's home were cultured in Gram-negative enrichment broth followed by selective media. _C. sakazakii_ isolates were recovered from both the powdered formula and the water container. WGS was performed and identified 2 distinct strains of _C. sakazakii_ (Figure). Sequence reads were cleaned, assembled, and analyzed using high-quality single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis; results showed that the patient isolate was closely genetically related to an isolate from the powdered formula (0 SNPs apart). A 2nd isolate from the same can of powdered formula was closely genetically related to an isolate from the water container (within 4 SNPs). These 2 strains were not related to one another (>50 000 SNPs apart). Federal partners tested unopened powdered formula from the same lot as the powdered formula consumed by the patient; _C. sakazakii_ was not detected.

The 2nd case occurred in February 2022 in a preterm (gestation of 30 weeks, 6 days), hospitalized male infant (patient B) born by cesarean delivery because of breech presentation and the mother's worsening preeclampsia. At the time of illness onset, he was being treated in the neonatal intensive care unit for complications of prematurity but was stable, feeding, growing, and breathing without respiratory support. He was fed expressed breast milk fortified with liquid human milk fortifier primarily through an orogastric tube before becoming ill. At age 20 days, he experienced apneic and bradycardic episodes, temperature elevation, and a requirement for respiratory support. Seizures developed the following day. _C. sakazakii_ was isolated from blood and CSF cultures. Despite treatment with intravenous antibacterials and repeat negative blood cultures, the patient died 13 days after illness onset.

Expressed milk samples, breast pump parts from 2 separate devices (one used in the hospital and one used in the mother's home), and liquid human milk fortifier samples from 3 lots were cultured in Gram-negative enrichment broth followed by selective media; _C. sakazakii_ was recovered from the breast pump parts used in the home. An interview revealed that these breast pump parts were cleaned in a household sink, sanitized, and sometimes assembled while still moist. No bacteria were recovered from the expressed milk samples, liquid human milk fortifier samples, hospital breast pump parts, or unopened powdered formula from the hospital. _C. sakazakii_ isolates from the patient's blood and CSF, and those isolated from environmental samples, were analyzed by WGS, which indicated that the patient's CSF and blood isolates were closely genetically related to the isolate recovered from the home breast pump (0-1 SNPs).

Discussion
----------
On the basis of the WGS analysis, these 2 cases of _C. sakazakii_ infection in infants were not related. One case was likely transmitted by powdered formula prepared in the home, and the other through expressed milk contaminated by breast pump equipment. These cases illustrate the ubiquity of the pathogen in the environment, the importance of hygiene in preventing _C. sakazakii_ infections, and the utility of WGS as a method for determining genetic relatedness and probable transmission sources. Understanding more about the sources of these infections can help educate clinicians and caregivers about ways to prevent _C. sakazakii_ infections among infants.

_C. sakazakii_ can cause meningitis and sepsis, most commonly in very young infants and those with a history of prematurity, possibly because of immaturity of their immune systems and gastrointestinal tracts (7). Although _C. sakazakii_ infections are treatable with antimicrobials, they often have devastating outcomes, with death occurring in nearly 40% of infants who develop meningitis (2). Many surviving infants also experience complications, including cerebral abscess and hydrocephalus, which can result in permanent neurologic sequelae (2). Because _C. sakazakii_ infection is not a nationally notifiable condition, the actual incidence is unknown. However, it is estimated that approximately 18 cases of invasive _C. sakazakii_ infection in infants occur annually in the USA, most of which are not associated with outbreaks but likely occur because of isolated instances of contamination of infant feeding products and equipment in the home (2,8).

Previous investigations have identified _C. sakazakii_ in opened powdered formula because of its notable ability to survive in dry environments. However, it has also been recovered from many other environmental sources in the home, including kitchen sink surfaces, pacifiers, bottles, household utensils, vacuum cleaning bags, and other foods (1,2). Feeding utensils, such as scoops used for powdered formula, can become contaminated on countertops or in sinks and subsequently transfer _C. sakazakii_ when reintroduced into the formula. Additional reports have linked _C. sakazakii_ infections to contaminated expressed breast milk after recovering the organism from breast pump equipment (3-5). Phenotypic methods of identification and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis have previously been used to identify _Cronobacter_ species and determine potential sources of transmission in cases of infant _C. sakazakii_ infections in the USA. However, these methods were limited and could not definitively identify genetic relatedness. Analysis of WGS data from these two cases permitted more accurate determinations of relatedness among isolates. In future investigations, WGS can be used to guide public health practitioners and clinicians about potential outbreaks or sources of _C. sakazakii_ related to illnesses.

The findings in this report are subject to at least 3 limitations. First, _C. sakazakii_ infections are not nationally notifiable or reportable in most states, so associations with other strains and detection of potential outbreaks are currently limited. Second, standardized methods for identifying and characterizing _C. sakazakii_ are not yet routine, further limiting wide-scale detection and surveillance efforts. Finally, on-site investigations were not performed, so the samples tested might not represent all potential sources of contamination (e.g., additional feeding products, equipment, or environmental surfaces).

Because of the widespread presence of _C. sakazakii_ in the environment, caregivers of infants should follow safe hygiene, preparation, and storage practices, and learn steps to protect infants from infection. Clinicians providing care for infants aged <2 months or those who were born prematurely or are immunosuppressed should explain the risks of _C. sakazakii_ infection to caregivers, especially if the infant is fed with powdered formula or expressed milk. Education should emphasize exploring alternatives to powdered formula for infants at highest risk and safe powdered formula preparation and storage (9). In addition, caretakers should be instructed to thoroughly clean and sanitize breast pump equipment (10). Hospitals caring for premature or critically ill infants might consider providing instructions and a dedicated basin for cleaning supplies at home upon hospital discharge to minimize the risk of contamination. Increased awareness of safe hygiene, preparation, and storage practices related to infant feeding products, enhanced understanding of _C. sakazakii_ reservoirs, and ongoing public health messaging can help prevent infant _C. sakazakii_ infections, complications, and deaths.

MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2023; 72(9): 223-6--------------------------------------------------------------------------------_Cronobacter sakazakii_, a species of Gram-negative bacteria belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family, is known to cause severe and often fatal meningitis and sepsis in young infants. _C. sakazakii_ is ubiquitous in the environment, and most reported infant cases have been attributed to contaminated powdered infant formula (powdered formula) or breast milk that was expressed using contaminated breast pump equipment (1-3). Previous investigations of cases and outbreaks have identified _C. sakazakii_ in opened powdered formula, breast pump parts, environmental surfaces in the home, and, rarely, in unopened powdered formula and formula manufacturing facilities (2,4-6). This report describes 2 infants with _C. sakazakii_ meningitis reported to CDC in September 2021 and February 2022. CDC used whole genome sequencing (WGS) analysis to link one case to contaminated opened powdered formula from the patient's home and the other to contaminated breast pump equipment. These cases highlight the importance of expanding awareness about _C. sakazakii_ infections in infants, safe preparation and storage of powdered formula, proper cleaning and sanitizing of breast pump equipment, and using WGS as a tool for _C. sakazakii_ investigations.In September 2021, a state public health department reported an infant with _C. sakazakii_ infection to CDC (patient A).

Contaminated cough and paracetamol syrups imported into Gambia almost certainly caused the deaths of 66 children due to acute kidney injury, according to an investigation led by the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention and Gambian scientists.

The links between the children's deaths and contaminated medicines first came to light in October [2022], when the World Health Organization sent out an alert saying 4 cough syrups made by India's Maiden Pharmaceuticals Ltd contained toxic levels of diethylene and ethylene glycol and should be withdrawn.

The new investigation ""strongly suggests"" medicines contaminated with the toxins, imported into Gambia, led to the cluster of acute kidney injury among 78 children. Most were aged under 2, and 66 died between June and September 2022. Four more children have since died, bringing the official toll up to 70.

Maiden has denied its drugs were at fault for the deaths in Gambia, and the Indian government has said the syrups showed no contamination when it tested them. Production at the factory was stopped in October [2022], but the company is now seeking to restart work.

The report [see citation below], published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Thursday [2 Mar 2023], reached its conclusions by looking at medical records of patients where available, as well as interviews with their parents and caregivers. It also says other evidence, such as the tests of the medicines, the wide geographic spread of the cases, and the fact the illness did not spread to adults, pointed towards a toxin rather than an infectious agent.

There have been a number of poisonings linked to diethylene and ethylene glycol in the past in countries including Haiti and Nigeria, but the report says this is the 1st known incident when imported medicines were at fault rather than domestically developed drugs.

""This likely poisoning event highlights the potential public health risks posed by the inadequate quality management of pharmaceutical exports,"" the report said.

Since the deaths in Gambia, 201 children have also died in Indonesia, and 19 in Uzbekistan, linked to different manufacturers' contaminated cough syrups.

[This is a huge tragedy. My heart goes out to the families affected. There is really no excuse for a company, any company, to distribute toxic medication.

Testing must be rigorous and excessively thorough, even for toxins, bacteria, or viruses deemed to be on the outer realms of possibility. Yes, such testing may be time-consuming and expensive, but nothing compares to taking the life of a human being, and many individuals in this case.

An earlier article stated that diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol ""are used as a cheaper alternative in some pharmaceutical products to glycerine, a solvent or thickening agent in many cough syrups.""
(<https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indian-state-drug-controller-finds-violations-maiden-pharma-factory-cnbc-tv18-2022-10-12/> from ProMED post 20221016.8706145)

This issue of a substitution of diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol is not limited to India. It appears to be a much broader situation, as it now encompasses Gambia and possibly Indonesia, and more cases could be discovered in other regions.

These glycols have been shown to be toxic in humans and have been known about for many years. While many may argue the dose makes the toxin, it could also be argued the child is much less able to metabolize or excrete these toxins.

This is a tragedy or unimaginable heartbreak. Hopefully those responsible will be held accountable. Profit over lives is never acceptable. - Mod.TG

Production at the factory was stopped in October [2022], but the company is now seeking to restart work.The report [see citation below], published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Thursday [2 Mar 2023], reached its conclusions by looking at medical records of patients where available, as well as interviews with their parents and caregivers. It also says other evidence, such as the tests of the medicines, the wide geographic spread of the cases, and the fact the illness did not spread to adults, pointed towards a toxin rather than an infectious agent.There have been a number of poisonings linked to diethylene and ethylene glycol in the past in countries including Haiti and Nigeria, but the report says this is the 1st known incident when imported medicines were at fault rather than domestically developed drugs.""This likely poisoning event highlights the potential public health risks posed by the inadequate quality management of pharmaceutical exports,"" the report said.Since the deaths in Gambia, 201 children have also died in Indonesia, and 19 in Uzbekistan, linked to different manufacturers' contaminated cough syrups.[Byline: Jennifer Rigby]--Communicated by:ProMED[This is a huge tragedy. My heart goes out to the families affected. There is really no excuse for a company, any company, to distribute toxic medication.Testing must be rigorous and excessively thorough, even for toxins, bacteria, or viruses deemed to be on the outer realms of possibility. Yes, such testing may be time-consuming and expensive, but nothing compares to taking the life of a human being, and many individuals in this case.An earlier article stated that diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol ""are used as a cheaper alternative in some pharmaceutical products to glycerine, a solvent or thickening agent in many cough syrups.""(<https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indian-state-drug-controller-finds-violations-maiden-pharma-factory-cnbc-tv18-2022-10-12/> from ProMED post 20221016.8706145)This issue of a substitution of diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol is not limited to India. It appears to be a much broader situation, as it now encompasses Gambia and possibly Indonesia, and more cases could be discovered in other regions.These glycols have been shown to be toxic in humans and have been known about for many years. While many may argue the dose makes the toxin, it could also be argued the child is much less able to metabolize or excrete these toxins.This is a tragedy or unimaginable heartbreak.

<https://en.mercopress.com/2023/02/21/argentina-ups-security-measures-as-number-of-avian-flu-cases-grows>


Argentina's health authorities have decided to up their biosecurity measures following the increase in the number of avian flu cases detected nationwide, particularly in provinces bordering Uruguay, but also in Córdoba and Salta.

After declaring a sanitary emergency a few days ago, the National Agrifood Health and Quality Service (Senasa) reinforced epidemiological surveillance controls. Thus, the agency is dealing with cases in backyards, carrying out surveys in the areas where positive cases were detected.

The agency continues to carry out raking and surveillance in Córdoba and Salta, in addition to preventive controls in the province of Entre Ríos on the border with Uruguay.

In Córdoba, the positive cases of avian influenza were in 2 wild ducks at Las Mojarras lagoon in the Department of General San Martín, and in backyard turkeys located in Alejo Ledesma. In addition to verifying the general condition of the animals, a perimeter was delimited to track and verify possible additional cases.

In Salta, Senasa shut down a backyard establishment where the positive case occurred. Other joint measures were also taken with the provincial Ministry of Production as well as with the National Institute of Agricultural Technology (INTA).

In addition to border controls in Entre Ríos, Senasa continues to carry out checkups in areas bordering Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay, it was reported.

Meanwhile, new cases of avian influenza (AI) H5 were confirmed in the province of Santa Fe, Senasa acknowledged. The cases were recorded in the town of Villa Cañás, in backyard chickens and turkeys found dead.

Last week, the Agriculture Secretariat declared a nationwide sanitary emergency after confirming the 1st case of avian influenza in the country in Andean geese in Laguna de Pozuelos, in the north of the province of Jujuy.

Senasa urged the productive sector to reinforce all biosecurity measures and requested the immediate notification of any possible detection of ""nervous, digestive, or respiratory clinical signs; decrease in egg production, water, or feed consumption; and high mortality in domestic or wild birds.""

In case of suspicion of clinical signs compatible with avian flu, Senasa must be notified. However, Senasa Vice President Rodolfo Acerbi insisted avian influenza does not represent a danger to the human population in Argentina.

The cases of avian flu detected in Argentina are caused by migratory wild birds arriving from the northern hemisphere's winter, Senasa's Health Director Ximena Melón explained.

These birds go down to eat where there is poultry for human consumption, which is where contagion occurs, Melón added. Hence, this poultry should be confined. The signs are easy to recognize: ruffled feathers and diarrhea.

Avian flu is a zoonosis, which can be transmitted to humans, but only when a sick bird is touched or handled without protection.

Melón also explained avian flu cannot be transmitted through the consumption of eggs from sick birds.

<https://buenosairesherald.com/society/bird-flu-is-not-a-risk-for-the-general-public-government-says>


Vice-president of Argentina's National Healthcare and Agrifood Quality Service (Senasa) Rodolfo Acerbi said on Monday [20 Feb 2023] that the chances of people being affected by bird flu are low, stressing that the disease is not transmitted through consuming chicken or eggs.

""The only way people can get infected is if they handle dead or diseased birds,"" Acerbi told the news agency Télam, adding that avian influenza does not represent a risk to the health of the country's population.

In total, Senasa has confirmed 5 cases among wild birds and birds raised on small farms: the 1st one in Jujuy on 14 Feb [2023] and the latest in Santa Fe on 19 Feb [2023]. The disease has also been detected in Córdoba and Salta. So far, Senasa has received a total of 98 reported cases, which have yet to be confirmed.

Last Wednesday [15 Feb 2023], Health Access Secretary Sandra Tirado said in a press conference people should cook poultry well and consult with physicians if they show symptoms following direct contact with birds. Symptoms in humans can range from mild infections -- a fever or a cough -- to severe respiratory issues and pneumonia.

The Health Ministry also recommended adopting the following preventive measures:

- Frequently wash hands with water and soap or use alcohol-based disinfectants.
- Avoid contact with wild birds.
- In case of finding dead or sick birds, avoid contact and report them to the Senasa.
- Do not touch surfaces possibly contaminated with wild birds' or poultry's saliva, mucosa, or feces.
- There are currently no travel restrictions in place, but people going to areas that are potentially affected by bird flu are being urged to adopt preventive measures.

At the time of writing, the potentially affected areas identified by the ministry were Laguna de las Mojarras and Alejo Ledesma in Córdoba, Laguna de los Pozuelos in Jujuy, Cerrillos in Salta, and Villa Cañas in Santa Fe.

Senasa has reinforced its epidemiological monitoring in those areas, including disinfecting vehicles and farms. In Córdoba and Salta, inspections were held in the zones where the cases were detected, and there are preventive controls at the Uruguayan border in Entre Ríos.

The ministry also clarified that city birds such as pigeons and sparrows are low risk because they are not susceptible to the virus.

The spread of new cases across the region has raised alarms across Latin America, and the Argentine government will hold a summit today [21 Feb 2023] to discuss next steps. So far, cases have been confirmed in Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Uruguay, Chile, and Argentina. Suspected cases of the disease, which have not been confirmed, have been reported in Paraguay and Brazil.

You can report sightings of diseased or dead birds at local Senasa offices, by emailing <notificaciones@senasa.gob.ar>, by calling or sending a WhatsApp message to 11-5700-5704, by downloading the ""Notificaciones Senasa"" app, or on the Senasa website.

<https://www.plenglish.com/news/2023/02/22/4m-vaccine-doses-to-arrive-in-ecuador-to-fight-off-bird-flu-outbreak/>


Ecuador´s Agency of Regulation and Phytosanitary and Zoosanitary Control (AGROCALIDAD) on Wednesday [22 Feb 2023] confirmed the arrival of 4 million doses of vaccines against bird flu.

Since 2022, Ecuadorean authorities have detected several outbreaks in the provinces of Pichincha, Cotopaxi, Bolivar, and Tungurahua.

During 1st phase, AGROCALIDAD will allocate the new vaccine doses to the farms where bird flu cases were reported.

In a press release, AGROCALIDAD assured the new vaccine is safe and implies no risk for humans. Plus, AGROCALIDAD believes the new measure helps to reduce mortality rate of infected birds [by 40-80%].

Bird flu virus has been present in Ecuador since end-November 2022. To date [22 Feb 2023], about 1.2 million birds have died or been culled.

In January [2023], local authorities reported the 1st case of human transmission in a minor who was probably infected by direct contact with backyard poultry in the province of Bolivar.

According to the World Organization for Animal Health, bird flu virus is also affecting Canada, the United States, Mexico, Colombia, Peru ,and Chile, among others.

<https://mexicodailypost.com/2023/03/04/outbreak-of-avian-influenza-detected-in-three-aguascalientes-farms/>


After conducting an epidemiological investigation, the National Service for Agrifood Health, Safety and Quality (Senasica ) detected the outbreak of the AH5N1 avian influenza virus in 3 farms in the interior of the state of Aguascalientes. As a result, they implemented the quarantine and will strengthen surveillance to prevent the spread of the pathogen to other regions.

According to the official report, the 3 broiler farms were located in the municipalities of Aguascalientes, as well as in Asientos and Rincón de Romos. In order to prevent dispersion, the general directorate of animal health (DGSA) imposed a definitive quarantine in the 3 poultry production units that housed 826 800 birds.

Influenza AH5N1, also known as bird flu, is considered highly pathogenic, as it has a high chance of causing disease with strong and severe signs in the host. In addition, it can spread rapidly, so there is a risk of causing high mortality rates in different species of birds.

According to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO ), most avian influenza viruses are not zoonotic, meaning they cannot be easily transmitted between animals and humans. However, some strains with a high degree of pathogenicity may have the ability to spread to people, thus representing a ""threat to public health.""

The main route of transmission from birds to humans is direct or indirect contact with infected animals. However, there is also the spread of the virus through contact with environments or surfaces contaminated by feces, as well as handling carcasses and preparing birds for consumption.

""When avian influenza is transmitted to humans, symptoms in people can range from a mild upper respiratory infection (fever and cough) to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (difficulty breathing), shock, and even death,"" reported PAHO, so it is recommended to see a doctor in case of suspicion of contagion of the virus.

The migration of wild birds at the end of winter is one of the factors enhancing the spread of the bird flu virus

In this sense, some of the measures implemented by the veterinarians of the United States-Mexico Commission for the Prevention of Foot-and-Mouth Disease and other Animal Diseases (CPA) consist of the depopulation, cleaning, and disinfection of the 3 farms to comply with the sanitary vacuum and, later, find out the degree of security to return to house new bird populations later.

Another of the sanitary determinations applied consisted of the epidemiological review of family and commercial farms located within 10 km [6.2 mi] of the infected agricultural production units (UPA ), as well as internal quarantine in the state of Aguascalientes.

First identified in Weakley County in West Tennessee, the Tennessee Department of Agriculture released a statement on its website on 20 Jan [2023] disclosing the presence of a highly pathogenic avianinfluenza (HPAI) disease affecting poultry populations in West and Middle Tennessee farms.

According to the press release, ""HPAI cases in Tennessee have sickened domesticated chickens, geese, ducks, and turkeys in Bledsoe, Davidson, Obion, Tipton, and Weakley Counties"" dating back to September of 2022.

The most recent detection was among a commercial broiler chicken flock in Weakley County in West Tennessee, according to the state Department of Agriculture.

In an effort to combat HPAI spread, a 6.2 mile [10 km] control zone surrounding the Weakley Co. facility, which remains unnamed, has been implemented, and animal health officials are taking measures to eradicate the affected poultry supply, according to state agriculture officials.

Collection data from a 20 Jan 2023 report via the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service interactive map, affected flocks in Tennessee include 4 affected commercial flocks, 5 affected backyard flocks, and a total of 418 230 affected birds in the outbreak in 2023.

[Avian influenza enters its 2nd year of havoc on birds' lives and human livelihood.

As spring and summer arrives for the Northern Hemisphere, we can likely anticipate this viral menace will return with the spring migrations.

Currently, it appears to be causing havoc in its wake through the Southern Hemisphere.

Consequently, please take heed, and protect your birds. Increase your biosecurity. Examine your protocols and see where it could be tightened up. This may mean specific clothing per barn, or the same individuals enter one barn but not the next. It may mean deliveries are at different location for decontamination before entering the property. Remember, this virus can hitch itself to clothing, truck tires, boot soles, even our hair. Some facilities are already implementing procedures for requiring those entering to blow their noses and discard the tissue into designated sealed receptacles.

Nine horses are receiving ""close monitoring"" in hospital in Valencia, 8 of which are showing neurological signs of equine herpesvirus (EHV-1).

H&H reported that the organisers of the Mediterranean Equestrian Tour in Oliva Nova, Spain, had cancelled the 2nd part of the showjumping tour (7-26 Feb [2023]) as 4 horses on-site had tested positive for EHV-1. Ten horses, 6 of whom were showing signs of illness, were put in isolation on 21 Feb [2023]. Swabs were taken, 4 of which were positive, 4 negative, and 2 inconclusive. At the time, none of the horses were showing signs of neurological illness. The Valencia Veterinary department decided that all the horses stabled in the same tent as the 4 that had tested positive had to remain on the venue for at least one week.

In an update on 2 Mar [2023], a spokesman [for the FEI (Fédération Équestre Internationale; International Federation for Equestrian Sports)] said the Oliva organising committee had set up a ""strong organisation"" and continues to closely collaborate with the authorities, the national federation, and the FEI. The Spring MET III Tour (7-26 Mar [2023]) has been cancelled, and the organising committee has put meetings in place to keep all athletes informed on the most recent development.

The spokesman added that the venue is operating under the auspices of the regional veterinary authority, which is monitored by the federal veterinary authority, MAPA. An FEI vet has been appointed as responsible for the venue, leading the work on-site and reporting back to the regional veterinary authority.

""To date, there are 9 horses at the University Equine Hospital in Valencia (CEU) for close monitoring, 8 of which have displayed neurological signs. As a preventive measure and to ensure enough treating space, the FEI has ordered 12 temporary boxes to be set up at the hospital grounds in case more horses are brought in,"" said the FEI spokesman, adding that 103 horses remain at the venue in Oliva, and these have been divided into groups depending on their health status. ""The temperature of all horses at the venue is taken 2 to 3 times daily, and in the latest report from 1 March, no horse had presented fever or any clinical signs.""

MAPA, supported by the FEI, has extended the initial safety measures to avoid a further spread of virus from the venue. To leave the venue, horses must present a negative sample, followed by a 2nd sample 14 days later, and a 3rd on day 15. All 3 samples must be negative for EHV.

To be unblocked from the FEI database and return to competition, horses must fulfill certain health requirements: either 21 days' isolation with a nasopharyngeal sample taken on day 21 at the earliest, or a minimum isolation of 14 days, with a sample taken on day 7 and a 2nd sample taken 7 days later at the earliest. All samples must be analysed by a PCR and return negative. The measures also include twice-daily rectal temperatures.

""Release from isolation"" can only take place on the advice of a vet, and to compete at an FEI event, horses need to complete all return-to-competition precautions and have the restriction lifted by the FEI vet department.

In Lier, Belgium, where one horse had tested positive, the venue has been ""given the green light"" to reopen for competitions following an inspection by the Belgian national head vet. The affected horse, and each of the 25 in-contact horses, may not attend any FEI events until they have fulfilled ""certain health requirements"", which are imposed in order to minimise any potential transmission of the virus, to their own horses and the wider horse population.

Discussing the current status of the spread of the disease, the FEI spokesman confirmed 7 horses departed Oliva prior to the 1st confirmed case of EHV-1; one travelled to Valencia, Spain, 4 to Vejer de la Frontera, Spain, and 2 to Doha, Qatar. ""They were immediately isolated on request of the FEI and are currently applying the FEI return-to-competition protocols while in isolation. To date, none of the horses have been reported to present fever or clinical signs,"" he said.

The spokesman added that 6 horses returning from Oliva to Limburg, the Netherlands, have tested positive for EHV-1 and have been placed in quarantine, where they are being closely monitored. ""Unrelated to Oliva, in Vilamoura, Portugal, 2 horses with fever were placed in isolation; however, their test results for EHV-1 were negative,"" he said.

Las Vegas area health officials say legionnaires' disease was found in 2 people who stayed at the same hotel in recent months. The Southern Nevada Health District announced on Friday [3 Mar 2023] it is looking into 2 cases reported in guests who stayed at The Orleans Hotel & Casino a few miles west of the Strip. One guest visited there in January [2023], the other in December [2022]. The hotel is informing current and past guests going back to 16 Dec [2022] of possible exposure.

The Health District has taken water samples around the hotel and done other environmental testing. Officials say they confirmed the presence of legionella bacteria. The Orleans Hotel has since started remediation procedures and a water management plan.

Legionnaires' disease can develop from the inhaling of aerosol droplets of water contaminated with [legionella] bacteria. This can come from showers, hot tubs, cooling towers, misters, and decorative fountains. Experts say symptoms can surface 2 to 10 days after exposure and present like pneumonia. They include cough, shortness of breath, high fever, muscle aches, and headaches. The disease can be treated with antibiotics.

Health officials have set up a website for guests who experienced symptoms up to 14 days after their stay to fill out a survey.

[Legionnaires' disease is usually acquired by inhalation of aerosolized legionella bacteria, but the disease can also be acquired by aspiration of legionella-contaminated potable water in people prone to aspirate, such as debilitated hospitalized patients. Possible person-to-person transmission of legionnaires' disease has also been described by Correia et al (<http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356>). Legionella infection can be acquired less commonly by contamination of wounds.

Possible sources include aerosols generated from a legionella-contaminated plumbing system by showerheads, sink faucets, cooling towers, decorative fountains, hot tubs/spas, car-wash facilities, and even wastewater treatment plants. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 deg C (77-104 deg F) support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems.

Genotyping the isolates from patients with legionnaires' disease will help establish whether this is a common source outbreak, if the genotypes match. However, if the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of legionella will identify the environmental source for the individual cases. Because legionella may be found in water supplies without linkage to any cases, the actual causative source should be demonstrated by matching the genotype of the environmental isolates with that of clinical isolates to assure frequently costly corrective measures are carried out on the actual source (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC86783/> and <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730281/>). We will await further findings from the investigation.

About 20-25% of all legionnaires' disease reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is associated with travel. Legionnaires' disease is important to diagnose and report because its identification implies the presence of an environmental source to which other susceptible individuals are likely to be exposed. Clusters of legionnaires' disease associated with travel to hotels or aboard cruise ships are rarely detected by individual clinicians or health departments; travelers typically disperse from the source of infection before developing symptoms.

Therefore, a travel history should be actively sought from patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and legionella testing should be performed for those who have traveled in the 2 weeks before the onset of symptoms.

Because of the multi-state nature of travel in the United States, national-level surveillance is necessary to detect outbreaks of travel-associated legionnaires' disease. CDC relies upon state and local health departments to conduct this surveillance; all cases should be reported through National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). See the CDC legionellosis case report form at <https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/health-depts/surv-reporting/form-instructions.html>.

We would be pleased to hear from knowledgeable sources with more information on this outbreak. - Mod.ML

Three more children have been diagnosed with polio after an 8 year old in the northern city of Safed tested positive for the virus on Monday [27 Feb 2023].

A Health Ministry statement on Thursday [2 Mar 2023] said that the 3 children had been in contact with the infected child, who was unvaccinated, and tested positive for the polio virus despite having no symptoms. The ministry did not reveal the vaccination status of the 3 children who tested positive on Thursday [2 Mar 2023].

""In recent months, there is evidence of a spread of polio in many sewage systems in Israel, which has more than 150 000 children unvaccinated against the virus,"" the statement warned. The Health Ministry said it would continue to monitor and update the public, and encouraged people to maintain good hygiene practices to stymie any outbreak.

Following the case of polio in an 8-year-old girl from the Safed area who was not vaccinated against polio as part of routine vaccinations, the Northern District of the Ministry of Health conducted an epidemiological investigation, during which it was found that 3 other children who came in close contact with the case, were found to be positive for the polio virus. The 3 children at this stage have no clinical symptoms.

According to recent media reports, 4 children in Israel have been diagnosed with polio. The JPost reported the Health Ministry announced in early March 2023 that an unvaccinated child from the Safed region in Galilee was found positive for polio at the Ziv Medical Center.

On 2 Mar 2023, the Times of Israel reported an Israel Health Ministry statement confirming 3 additional children who had been in contact with the infected child and tested positive for poliovirus. The Ministry did not reveal the vaccination status of these 3 children.

In June 2022, the Ministry reported that vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (VDPV2) was detected in sewage in the Jerusalem area. This strain has spread to many places in Israel, from Ramat HaGolan, in the north, to Beer Sheva in the south.

Unfortunately, about 150 000 children in Israel have not been vaccinated with the inactivated vaccine, and therefore they are not protected from pediatric paralysis should they be infected with the virus. Polio is a vaccine-preventable viral disease that affects children and can cause paralysis and related fatalities. The live attenuated oral vaccine (bOPV) currently administered in Israel does not cover the VDPV2 strain.

[So far there is one case confirmed to have a poliovirus associated acute flaccid paralysis and 3 asymptomatically infected contacts of this case.

Information on genomic sequencing is still pending but the media reports seem to suggest it is associated with a cVDPV (circulating vaccine derived poliovirus). As mentioned in the prior post (Poliomyelitis update (09): Israel AFP, RFI, WPV1 ES, cVDPV1 & 2 AFP & ES 20230228.8708638) there was 1 AFP case in Jerusalem, Israel reported in March 2022 associated with a cVDPV3 infection (see prior posts in see also section below). In addition, a VDPV2 was identified in wastewater sampling matching VDPV2 identified in wastewater in the USA and the UK in August of 2022.

The estimate of 150 000 unvaccinated children in Israel is very disconcerting as it is a perfect environment for polioviruses (both wild as well as vaccine derived) to circulate if introduced into these pockets of susceptibles. Safed is known to have a sizable Haredi community, which may well mean a sizeable pocket of unvaccinated children and young adults.

Amid medicine shortage, polio outbreak feared in Pakistan as thousands refuse vaccination
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pakistan is one of the handful of countries where polio is still prevalent. A combination of poor delivery systems and superstitions arising out of religion-induced taboo is to blame for the problem. The latest anti-polio campaign in Pakistan was no different, as more than 62 000 families refused to vaccinate their children.

The highest number of refusals was registered in the Sindh province of Pakistan, where a total of 37 008 households refused to allow their children to take the polio vaccine. The province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) was 2nd with 20 305 refusals while Islamabad recorded 141, Balochistan 4902, and Punjab 36. The port city of Karachi -- the economic nerve centre of Pakistan -- also recorded a high refusal rate.

While Karachi East registered a 2.4% rejection rate, Korangi district had a 1.2% denial rate. Karachi South registered 1.1% refusals, Keamari district had 1.3%, Karachi Central 1.7%, and Malir district 0.9%. In the Hyderabad district of Sindh, 0.2% families refused to vaccinate their children against polio.

The polio vaccination campaign started in January [2023] after wild poliovirus was found in sewage samples collected from Lahore. A report by the national polio lab at the National Institute of Health revealed on 19 Jan 2023 that the 1st sample which tested positive for polio of in 2023 was genetically related to the poliovirus discovered in the Nangarhar province of Afghanistan in November last year [2022].

This was the 1st known instance of cross-border transmission of polio from Afghanistan to Pakistan in over a year. On 27 Jan 2023, a 2nd sample also tested positive for polio and it was genetically related to a polio virus found in the southern part of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan.

The rate of syphilis cases in Saskatchewan has seen a massive jump since an outbreak was first declared in 2019. Dr Ibrahim Khan, regional medical officer of health for Indigenous Services Canada, said that, in 2022, 850 were cases found, an increase of 639% from several years ago. ""In 2019, we saw an unprecedented number of syphilis and that led to a declaration of a syphilis-specific outbreak in December of 2019,"" said Khan. ""Since then, we have seen a constant increase in the number of cases and basically the number of syphilis impacting pregnant women and babies born with syphilis.""

Between 2020 and now [March 2022], 7 babies have been stillborn because of syphilis and another 24 cases of early congenital infection in newborns have been reported in on-reserve population. ""These are really very high numbers for the Indigenous population,"" Khan explained. [see graphic at source URL].

The incidence of syphilis in Prince Albert grew 8.5% between 2021 and 2022 with 268 cases diagnosed last year [2022], the Saskatchewan Health Authority reported. That does not include numbers seen in reserve populations. The numbers are counted separately because on-reserve health is a federal area of responsibility while provinces manage the remainder of the population.

Increased cases are not isolated to Prince Albert or Saskatchewan; both Manitoba and Alberta have higher numbers as well.

For pregnant women, the potential impact on their baby is staggering. Between 70% and 100% of cases caught during the late stages of pregnancy transmit from mother to child and 40% in earlier stages of pregnancy. Syphilis can also spread through breastfeeding and can cause pre-term births (23%) and low birth weights, and has a 26% risk of stillbirth and a 16% chance of neonatal death.

""With syphilis, which we call early congenital syphilis or babies born diseased to a mother that had been infected with syphilis, those numbers broke all previous records,"" said Khan. Caring for even one baby born with early congenital syphilis is considered an emergency in the health care field, he explained, and is currently a priority for all concerned.

Officials are working towards increasing the resources and accessibility for people with the condition. Many of the expectant mothers on reserve do not have easy access to health care because of their location so 2 mobile clinics have been put into service. The hope is with increased focus and effort, the number of new cases can be reduced by one half.

One such effort is giving nurses the ability to test a patient and treat them the same day. Treatment includes medication and monitoring of the patient. Health care staff are also hoping to reduce some of the stigma attached so that more people will choose to be tested and then follow up with treatment. ""We want to have Indigenous-led, holistic, trauma-informed care available for these clients wherever they live,"" Khan said. Treating the mother with antibiotics before the baby is born can eliminate any potential health impacts.

[""Saskatchewan is home to at least 70 First Nations [Indigenous] and various Métis [people of mixed European and Indigenous ancestry] communities. It contains 782 reserves, settlements and villages, many of which are located in the southern half of the province. Reserves in Saskatchewan were created between 1874 and 1906 by Treaties 2, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 10. As of 2016, 47.5% of the province's 114 570 self-identified First Nations peoples live on reserves, a percentage comparable to the province of Manitoba. Most of the remaining 47% who reside off-reserve in Saskatchewan live in the cities of Saskatoon, Regina and Prince Albert. While roughly 75% of Saskatchewan's reserve lands are within 50 km (31 mi) of other reserves in the southern half of the province, those in the northern half are more dispersed, and some are isolated from cities or towns. No year-long roads directly reach these reserves, which means that people and supplies are mainly moved in and out by airplane or snowmobile.

""The median age of Indigenous peoples living on Saskatchewan reserves is approximately 20 years old, which is half the age of the province's median non-Indigenous population outside of the reserves. In 2011, 59% of people living on the province's reserves are unemployed, compared with a 40% Indigenous unemployment rate off the reserves. About 69% of Indigenous children on Saskatchewan reserves live in poverty, the nation's 2nd-highest rate after Indigenous children living on reserves in Manitoba. The suicide rate for both children and adults is 4 times that of the rest of the population. Drug addiction is a further issue on the reserves."" (<https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/reserves-in-saskatchewan>)

In 2019, 2021 and 2022, ProMED posted reports of the increased incidence of primary and secondary syphilis in women, as well as congenital syphilis, in several Canadian provinces and territories (Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, Saskatchewan, and the Northwest Territories). Also mentioned as a contributing factor to the increase in syphilis cases in Canada is illicit drug use, in particular, methamphetamine. Transmission of syphilis in illicit drug users may occur as a consequence of sharing a needle/syringe contaminated with infected blood from somebody who has primary or secondary syphilis (<https://health.ucsd.edu/news/2010/pages/4-28-syphillis-needle-sharing.aspx>), but more likely the infection is acquired by the practice of exchanging drugs for sex and high-risk sexual behaviors, such as multiple partners and inconsistent condom use (<https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6806a4.htm>).

In 2019 ProMED reported on an outbreak of primary and secondary syphilis in Saskatchewan that affected in part Indigenous women of child-bearing age in the province -- 43% of cases were women compared to just 7% in 2017. An increase in the incidence of syphilis in women in the population is commonly accompanied by increasing rates of congenital syphilis (ProMED post Syphilis - Canada (08): (SK, ON) incr. incidence, indigenous, women, meth use 20191212.6836885). Illicit drug use was cited as a contributing factor to the increase in syphilis cases in 2019 in Saskatchewan, as well as in the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Ontario, and Manitoba.

Because many of the Indigenous communities are isolated, access to healthcare may be difficult. Mention was made in a 2021 ProMED report of initiating mobile syphilis clinics to rapidly screen and treat early syphilis in Saskatchewan (ProMED post Syphilis - Canada: (SK) incr incidence, women, congenital, RFI 20210526.8381023), as is reported in the news report above.

More information from knowledgeable sources on the possible use of illicit drugs as a contributing factor in the current outbreak in Saskatchewan would be appreciated. - Mod.ML

In a follow-up on the diphtheria outbreak in Nigeria, between week 19 (mid-May) of 2022 and week 7 (mid-February) of 2023, 724 suspected cases of diphtheria were reported from 20 states in Nigeria, with the majority of cases reported from Kano (533, 74%), Yobe (86, 12%), Katsina (45, 6%), Sokoto (14, 2%), Enugu (9, 1%), Ogun (7, 1%), Osun (7, 1%), Kaduna (6, 1%), Lagos (5, 1%), and Zamfara (5, 1%) states, the World Health Organization reports.

A total of 89 deaths were recorded among all suspected cases, representing a case fatality rate of 12.3%. Of suspected cases, 313 cases were confirmed.

Children aged 2-14 years account for 85.2% of confirmed cases. Only 43.2% of confirmed cases were fully vaccinated with a vaccine containing diphtheria toxin.

Last week, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a travel notice for Nigeria due to the outbreak.

[ProMED's recent post -- a news report that cited the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) -- said the diphtheria outbreak involved 5 Nigerian states (Kano, Lagos, Yobe, Osun, and Katsina), with a total of 522 suspected cases, 216 confirmed cases and 40 deaths (ProMED post Diphtheria - Nigeria (04): fatal 20230215.8708396).

The report above says the outbreak dates from mid-May 2022 to mid-February 2023, with apparently 411 suspected cases and 313 confirmed cases, and involves 20 Nigerian states. The Nigerian State of Kano accounts for most cases.

The US CDC issued a travel alert on 24 Feb 2023 concerning the diphtheria outbreak in several states in Nigeria (<https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/alert/diphtheria-nigeria>).

In a follow-up on the report of Lassa fever in Ghana, the Ghana Health Service reports 12 additional Lassa fever cases who were close contacts of the initial cases. This brings the total to 14 confirmed cases in the current outbreak. One death has been recorded.

The 13 surviving cases are in stable condition and being managed by designated health facilities. A total of 97 contacts have been identified.

ProMED from HealthMap Alerts

[The 12 new Lassa fever cases presumably occurred in the Greater Accra area where the original cases are located. These new cases are of concern because they indicate that ongoing transmission has been occurring. They were contacts with the previous cases who presumably were the source of their infections or perhaps the environment, food or water that were contaminated by infected rodents were the sources. Transmission of the virus can occur when in contact with the excrement of infected rodent hosts or with infected individuals as sometimes happens in hospitals or in settings where home care is provided. It will be of interest to see if the 97 additional contact are infected or not. It is good to learn that Ghana health officials are identifying and monitoring these contacts.

As noted earlier, halting the acquisition of Lassa fever virus infection at its source -- at the village level -- is not easy. As noted previously, it can be difficult to get local people to understand that virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_), or its excreta. Preventing this contact requires understanding that leads to action. Rodent control and prevention of contact with rodent excreta have to be undertaken at village level with individual households. This requires an extensive and continuous public education effort. Transmission of the virus also occurs at home or in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed and barrier-nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff or other care-givers from the blood and secretions of infected patients. Although no vaccine is available, ribavirin has been used to successfully treat patients and is most effective if patients are treated early in the course of infection.

The latest data from the United Kingdom Health Security Agency (UKHSA) shows that scarlet fever infections remain high and are fluctuating with levels similar to those seen during the last comparably high season in 2017 to 2018.

The number of weekly notifications of invasive group A streptococcal infections (iGAS) in children has slowed since December 2022. High levels of activity at such an early point in the season remains a concern, with further increases possible in the coming weeks as we move towards the usual peak time of the year for infections. While iGAS is still very rare, notifications remain relatively high in children compared to what we typically see -- these rates are more in keeping with the previous high season of 2017 to 2018.

There continue to be increased notifications in older adult age groups, and as in previous seasons, the majority of iGAS cases have continued to be among those aged over 45 years, particularly in those aged over 75 years.

Dr Derren Ready, UKHSA incident director, said: ""Scarlet fever notifications have fallen significantly since the peak in December [2022] but remain at a high level. This decline should be treated with caution as spring is usually the period of the year that we could see infections rise again. Please contact NHS 111 or your GP if you suspect you or your child have scarlet fever -- with symptoms such as fever, sore throat, difficulty swallowing and a sandpapery rash.""

Most winter illnesses can be managed at home, and NHS.UK has information to help parents look after children with mild illnesses. Contact NHS 111 or your GP surgery if you think your child is getting worse, for instance, if they are feeding or eating less than normal, are dehydrated, have a high temperature that won't go down, are very hot and sweaty or seem more tired or irritable than normal.

It is important that we continue to help stop the spread of all germs in the community and to vulnerable groups. Wash your hands regularly and thoroughly, catch coughs and sneezes in a tissue, and keep your home well ventilated. If you are unwell with any infection, you should avoid visiting vulnerable people, and stay away from school, nursery or work if you are unwell with a fever.

So far this season (from 12 Sep 2022 to 28 Feb 2023), there have been 47 084 notifications of scarlet fever. In the last comparable high season of 2017 to 2018 (September to September), there were 30 768 scarlet fever notifications overall across the year.

Invasive group A strep infections remain rare but are currently higher than expected in a typical year. So far this season, there have been:
- 2178 iGAS cases across all age groups, compared to 2898 across the whole of the last comparably high season in 2017 to 2018;
- 242 iGAS cases in children aged 1 to 4 years compared to 194 cases in the 2017 to 2018 season; and
- 160 cases in children aged 5 to 9 years, compared to 112 during the 2017 to 2018 season.

Sadly, so far this season, there have been 285 deaths across all age groups in England. This figure includes 35 children under 18 years in England. In the 2017 to 2018 season (September to September), there were 354 deaths in total across the season, including 27 deaths among children under 18 years.

The Caxias do Sul Municipal Secretariat of Health reports the confirmation of a case of yellow fever in a howler monkey this year [2023]. It is the 1st suspected and then confirmed [yellow fever] event in 2023 and serves as an alert to the circulation of the disease. No other cases have been under investigation until now.

The animal was found dead in Parada Cristal [when? - Mod.RNA], considered peri-urban area (transition between rural areas and urban areas). [Question: Has entomological research been carried out in the area? Were vaccine intensification actions triggered for the susceptible humans residing and/or frequenting the area? - Mod.RNA].

According to veterinarian Rogério Poletto, technical director of environmental health surveillance, in rural environments yellow fever is transmitted by the haemagogus mosquito, which lives in hollows of trees, stone holes, bromeliads, that is, in places difficult to control.

In urban areas, the mosquito that transmits yellow fever is _Aedes aegypti_, the same vector of dengue. In this case, the main way of prevention is to eliminate items with standing water to stop the reproduction of the mosquito since it is in these places that the aedes deposits its eggs.

""The howler monkey with confirmed yellow fever is a sign that yellow fever virus is cycling. That is why it is so important that the unvaccinated population get vaccinated, either the resident population or transient individuals who are those people who do tourism or work only during the harvest period,"" explains Poletto. The most recent human case of yellow fever inin Caxias do Sul occurred in 2018, when a resident contracted the disease in another state.

[Surveillance of epizootics is one of the main pillars of yellow fever surveillance. When epizootics occur, they must be considered a potential sentinel event (suggestive of virus circulation), often preceding the occurrence of human cases of disease in a given locality, including perturbed environments. For this reason, the actions to be triggered are complex and involve the investigation of primate deaths, entomological research, identification of viral circulation, active search for human cases (syndromic surveillance would be one strategy), confirmation of viral circulation, vaccination of the human population susceptible at risk, control of vector infestation in peri-urban areas close to the focus, and training of the network of assistance for detection and management of human cases. - Mod.RNA (in Portuguese, trans. Mod.TY)

Although the death of a single howler monkey of yellow fever may seem insignificant, as the above report and Mod.RNA indicate, it is an early warning of the presence of circulating virus in the area and risk to people residing in or travelling through the locality. This observation can provide time to intensify surveillance and to mount vaccination efforts for those who have not received the vaccine.

Not only is yellow fever of public health threat, it is also of concern for conservation of non-human primates. One of these is the golden lion tamarin, _Leontopithecus rosalia_, a primate endemic to the Atlantic Forest biome that once stretched uninterrupted for hundreds of miles along Brazil's eastern coast, but which has since been reduced to only patches. By the 1980s, _L. rosalia_ was critically endangered due to habitat loss and extremely high levels of poaching. These tamarins are very susceptible to yellow fever and may die of the infection as does the northern brown howler monkey (_Alouatta guariba guariba_), a species of howler monkey that lives in forests in south eastern Brazil and far north eastern Argentina (Misiones). It is listed as critically endangered. Animal experts in Brazil are vaccinating the golden lion tamarin population against yellow fever (<https://apnews.com/article/science-brazil-climate-and-environment-health-animals-8914729b25c06e1fb2f9e5eaec9d7981>). - Mod.TY

As of 2 Mar 2023 local time, 18 cases of leptospira [infection] have been confirmed in Ecuador, 16 of which are located in Duran City, Guayas Province in the west of the country, and 2 are located in Guayaquil, the largest city in the country.

On 2 Mar 2023, in response to leptospirosis, staff from the Duran City Public Health Department carried out awareness and prevention efforts in areas of the city where stagnant water exists. On the same day, the Guayaquil municipal government also carried out fumigation interventions in some high-risk areas.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by bacteria of the genus _Leptospira_. Humans become infected through contact with the urine of infected rodents, dogs, pigs, cows, etc., or through contact with water, soil, or food that has been contaminated with the urine of infected animals.

Clinical features of leptospirosis include fever, headache, myalgia, conjunctival injection, jaundice, and general malaise. Liver and kidney failure and diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage may occur in severe cases, which is life-threatening.

[Heavy rainfall in February 2023 caused freshwater flooding in multiple regions of Ecuador (<https://floodlist.com/america/ecuador-floods-february-2023>). Many species of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and rats) are susceptible to chronic kidney infection with pathogenic leptospira. Leptospirosis is usually acquired after contact of skin or mucous membranes with the urine of infected animals or by contact with freshwater, wet soil or vegetation that has been contaminated by the urine of leptospira-infected animals, especially rats. Leptospira shed in the urine of chronically infected animals may survive in freshwater or moist soil for weeks to months.

The Military School reported this Thursday [2 Mar 2023] that the disease that forced the hospitalization of 25 cadets was a rhinovirus infection, according to tests analyzed by the Institute of Public Health (ISP). The Military School's statement indicated that the 25 cadets who were hospitalized after presenting with serious respiratory symptoms in recent days, had been diagnosed with rhinovirus infection.

The event dates back to 25 Feb 2023, when 25 first-year cadets were admitted to the Military Hospital in Santiago for a serious respiratory condition, for which they had to be isolated and examined. Even until yesterday, Wednesday [1 Mar 2023], t12 cadets were in hospital for this disease. But this Thursday [2 Mar 2023], the results of the tests carried out by the ISP confirmed the initial diagnosis as ""common pathogen rhinovirus ruling out other communicable diseases such as Hantavirus, avian influenza and COVID-19"".

The Military School added that all the cadets are now in good condition, and that most have been discharged from the Military Hospital, completing their quarantine period at the school. ""The medical evolution of the patients has been satisfactory with the established medical treatment, finding all the admitted students in good condition, so that a large part of them have already been discharged from the Military Hospital of Santiago and referred to the Military School, where they are completing their quarantine period,"" the institution said in a statement.

Finally, the institution added that ""it will continue to carry out the necessary actions to achieve the full recovery of all its students and reiterates its deep commitment to their well-being. In addition, and in parallel, it keeps parents informed in a timely manner about the evolution of our cadets.""

In San Marco in Lamis, in the province of Foggia, mayor Michele Merla has confirmed that there are 5 human cases of trichinellosis. In this case, the ASL (Azienda Sanitaria Locale) Foggia veterinary hygiene service for food of animal origin has started control and verification of food products with suspected trichinella contamination.

According to what has been learned, one of the 5 people involved has been hospitalized at the Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza Hospital in San Giovanni Rotondo, while the other 4 are continuing treatment at home. Before these cases, the human outbreaks observed in Apulia in recent years were caused by the consumption of raw horse meat imported from abroad, wild-bred and clandestinely slaughtered pigs, and uncontrolled wild boar products. Again, the cause could be the consumption of game meat, perhaps wild boar, which has not been checked and came to table after a hunting trip. Now health workers are rebuilding the chain of infection, not from person to person, but through food.

The number of cases has risen to 10 and the most accredited hypothesis by the hygienists of the ASL of Foggia is that the parasite was acquired by consumption of unregulated wild boar meat, which would have arrived on the table of positive people after a hunting trip in the Dauni Mountains. Trichinellosis is once again being talked about in Puglia, after the hospitalization of the 1st positive person at Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza, the hospital founded by San Pio in San Giovanni Rotondo.

[Human trichinellosis due to consumption of infected wild boar meat has been a problem for many years in southern Italy, and the Apulia region in particular (ref 1). The source of infection is typically illegally hunted wild boar, eaten by family and friends of the hunter, but may also be homemade wild boar sausage that has entered the marketplace, neither of which sources is properly subjected to veterinary inspection.

Virtually all the _Trichinella_ species detected in both wild boar and human cases in Italy is _T. britovi_, as opposed to _T. spiralis_, the species that is classically associated with swine infections. A recent citizen science survey in southern Italy of 139 160 wild boar hunted during 2015-2021 found a higher infection rate among boar in Apulia than the other 3 regions of southern Italy. The highest prevalence of infected boar was found in areas at least 400 meters above sea level, indicating wider circulation of _T. britovi_ at high altitudes, due to less anthropogenic pressure and increased carnivorous and scavenging behaviours (ref 2).

_T. britovi_ appears to be more resistant to freezing than _T. spiralis_ (ref 3), which is another reason that proper cooking (heating the meat to an internal temperature of 65°C [149°F] for at least one minute) is the recommended method for killing trichinella larvae.

ProMED welcomes any well-founded information that may help establish the source of infection in these cases of human trichinellosis in San Marco in Lamis, Foggia, whether due to infected wild boar or another source.

The number of reports of syphilis, a sexually transmitted disease, is increasing rapidly in Tokyo. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government announced that it will open a free inspection station next month [March 2023]. It is possible to be tested ""anonymously"" without revealing your identity.

Tokyo governor Koike's regular press conference was held from 2:00 pm on 17 Feb 2023. Usually, the new coronavirus countermeasures and calls for power saving continue, but this day was different: ""Recently, syphilis has become a problem.""

Governor Koike mentioned at the regular press conference that the number of reports of syphilis infections is increasing rapidly. The number of reports of syphilis infection is increasing nationwide, but the infection situation in Tokyo seems to be particularly serious. Last year [2022], 3677 infections were reported [in Tokyo?], the highest number since the survey began in 1999. Between 2016 and 2020, the number hovered around 1700. Last year [2022], it more than doubled.

By gender, 2291 males and 1386 females were infected. Compared with 10 years ago, the number of male cases was 9 times higher (263 cases in 2012), while the number of female cases was about 40 times higher (34 cases in 2012). Although the rapid increase in the number of women infected is conspicuous, most of them are in their 20s.

In particular, when a pregnant woman is infected with syphilis, not only the mother but also the fetus can be infected through the placenta, which is considered very dangerous.

Immediately after the war, the number of patients in Japan was over 200 000, but the number decreased due to the development of antibacterial drugs. The increasing trend in recent years is said to be due to sexual acts with an unspecified number of people who met on social media and dating apps.

Last year [2022], the number of reported infections nationwide exceeded 10 000 for the 1st time since the current counting method was adopted. It may be said that there is a rapid increase in infections due to the era of ""Reiwa"". [Reiwa is the current era, which began on 1 May 2019, the day on which Emperor Akihito's elder son, Naruhito, ascended the throne as the 126th emperor of Japan. - Mod.ML]

In response to this situation, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government announced that it will set up free inspection stations at 4 locations in Tokyo for 4 days next month [March 2023]. The test results will be available on the same day. Inspection stations will be set up in Shinjuku on 3 Mar 2023, Kinshicho on 7 Mar 2023, Tachikawa on 11 Mar 2023, and Tama Center on 16 Mar 2023.

Of these, the test site in Shinjuku is exclusively for women, but it is said that it is not bound by the gender on the family register. The test is pre-booked, and it is not necessary to reveal your name or address when applying. Considering the history of the infection, it can be said that ""anonymous"" testing is effective.

To prevent infection, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare and local governments are also calling on people to ""use condoms properly"". At a press conference, Governor Koike also said, ""We can prevent the spread of infection if each and every one of us has correct knowledge and tries to take appropriate actions.""

Israel's Health Ministry announces that a case of polio has been diagnosed in an unvaccinated child in Safed. The child was brought into a local hospital with weakness in his limbs and was tested, leading to the diagnosis. Health officials are now looking into the child's contacts to identify any others who may have been affected.

Polio is a viral disease that mainly affects children and can cause disability, paralysis, and death. Today, polio vaccinations are standard for children and are an effective preventive measure, but vaccine skepticism has enabled the disease to pop up from time to time.

The child arrived at the hospital with limb weakness and after an inquiry at the National Virus Laboratory, the sample was found to be positive for the polio virus. There are about 150 000 unvaccinated children in Israel and there is evidence of the continued existence of polio in the sewers in many communities.

The Ministry of Health mentions that the main way to protect children from paralysis is through a killed polio vaccine. To prevent transmission of the virus it is important to maintain hand hygiene.

The district health bureau will open an epidemiological investigation and contact close contacts of the child to provide specific instructions. According to the findings of the investigation, a decision will be made on additional recommendations. The Ministry of Health will continue monitoring and update the findings.

Polio is a virus that causes paralysis in children, which has been eradicated from many countries in the world thanks to effective and safe vaccines that have been known for decades. No child in the State of Israel in 2023 should suffer from polio. A vaccinated child is a protected child.

Polio is a virus that causes paralysis in children, which has been eradicated from many countries in the world thanks to effective and safe vaccines that have been known for decades. About a month ago [January 2023], members of a delegation from the World Health Organization arrived in Israel, touring countries with ongoing polio outbreaks, with the aim of examining the ways of coping in Israel, sampling, monitoring, and vaccination. The polio outbreak in Israel began in February 2022, when a Jerusalem girl arrived at the hospital with paralysis. Since then there has been evidence of continued circulation of the virus, by its detection in sewers in various cities throughout the country.

Dr Sharon Elroei Price, head of public health services at the Ministry of Health, explained to Walla that there is no reason to worry about the special delegation that arrived in Israel, but about the disease itself: ""Most children who are infected do not develop symptoms, in 20% of cases there are symptoms of a viral disease, and in less than 1% of cases in unvaccinated children there can be paralysis. From 2013 there was no evidence of polio in Israel until the case of the Jerusalem girl.""

ProMED

[This report was originally found in English as a live blog on the Times of Israel website (section [1A] above. According to a brief report in The Jerusalem Post, the affected child is 8 years old and lives near the city of Safed. ""An investigation will be conducted among the child's close family and friends to verify the diagnosis."" (<https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-732873>)

From the reports available it appears as though this is a case of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) suspected to be caused by poliovirus, with the Ministry of Health having issued an early official alert. One wonders if there were positive environmental samples in the early results of the epidemiologic investigation.

As a reminder, one AFP case in Jerusalem Israel was reported in March 2022, associated with a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 3 (cVDPV3) infection (see prior posts in the see also section below). In addition, a vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (VDPV2) was identified in wastewater sampling matching the VDPV2's identified in wastewater in the USA and the UK in August of 2022.

In 2013 positive environmental samples of WPV1 were identified at first in the south of Israel and moving north. No AFP cases were associated with this event (see 2013 ProMED polio posts below). At that time Israel had been using inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) alone for vaccination. To stop the ongoing transmission of wild poliovirus (WPV), the oral polio vaccine (OPV) was reintroduced to the vaccination program as a mixed schedule -- IPV followed by OPV.

We await further information.

Safed has a long and rich history through millennia. It is located in the northern Galilee in Israel and is the highest city in the country (<https://www.touristisrael.com/safed/5681/>). It is considered a holy city in Judaism. It was a refuge for the 1492 Spanish expulsion Sephardic population. It was said to have been originally founded by one of Noah's sons after the Flood.

""The Jerusalem Talmud mentions Safed as one of 5 elevated spots where fires were lit to announce the New Moon and festivals during the Second Temple period."" ""The city today has a large Haredi community and remains a center for Jewish religious studies.""
(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safed>)
The mention of a sizable Haredi community may well mean a sizeable pocket of unvaccinated children and young adults.

[Iraq's immediate notification of the event was submitted on 26 Jan 2023. The 5 follow-up reports (FURs) published since, were submitted on 1, 3, 3, 12, and 26 Feb 2023. All are available at <https://wahis.woah.org/#/in-event/4856/dashboard>.

Follow-up report no.5 presents 9 new outbreaks, similarly spread from the extreme north west to the south east of the country, reported from the following locations/provinces: Mosil/Ninawa, Karbala/Karbala, Dayala/Diyala, Al-Diwania/Al-Qadisiyah, Baghdad/Baghdad, Babil/Babil, Alnajaf/An-Najaf, Alramadi/Al-Anbar, and Al-Basrah/Al-Basrah.

Outbreaks have been reported, since the start of the event in January 2023, from locations spread throughout Iraq, from Mosul in the north-west, bordering north east Syria and south east Turkey (the ""Kurdish triangle""), down to the south east, bordering Kuwait on the south and south west Iran on the east. All 23 outbreaks are presented on WOAH's updated (26 Feb 2023) map, at <https://wahis.woah.org/#/in-event/4856/dashboard>.

Information on the genotyping results of the strain involved may allow tracing the origin of the pathogen, its route of introduction, and its relationship with other FMDV SAT-2 strains, in particular the Jordanian strain and East-African strains.

The WRLFMD, Pirbright, publishes test results after obtaining the consent of the relevant country to do so. When Iraq's consent is given, the genotyping results are expected to become available on Iraq's page (<https://www.wrlfmd.org/western-and-central-asia/iraq#panel-7312>).

The continuing circulation of the exotic virus in Iraq is a cause for great concern, regionally, warranting alertness -- particularly in neighboring Syria, Iran, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia. The situation in Jordan is discussed in ProMED post 20230303.8708700. - Mod. AS

DHEC [South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control] is investigating an outbreak at a nursing center in Fairfield County [South Carolina]. The health agency says they are looking into multiple cases of legionnaire's disease at the Ridgeway Manor Healthcare Center.

People can catch the infection after breathing in mists from a water source like air conditioning, cooling towers and showers that are contaminated with the bacteria.

According to the Pritzker Law Firm, DHEC is working with the nursing center to put preventative measures in place and to find the source of the contamination.

[Ridgeway Manor Healthcare Center is a skilled nursing, short-term rehabilitation, and 112-bed long-term care facility in Ridgeway, South Carolina, United States (<https://health.usnews.com/best-nursing-homes/area/sc/ridgeway-manor-healthcare-center-425158>). Ridgeway (population 266 residents in 2020) is a town in Fairfield County, 24 miles (39 km) south of the city of Columbia, the state capital (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridgeway,_South_Carolina>).

Legionella are Gram negative bacilli that are found in both natural freshwater environments, such as lakes and streams, and in manufactured plumbing systems. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 deg C (77-104 deg F) support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems.

Humans usually acquire these organisms by inhalation of aerosolized legionella from contaminated water sources. Aerosols can spread for distances outdoors wafting on air currents downwind from their source. In fact, during the outbreak of pneumonia among legionnaires meeting at a hotel in Philadelphia in 1976 that was subsequently thought to be due to inhalation of aerosolized _Legionella pneumophila_ within the hotel, some passersby on Broad Street in front of the hotel, who had never entered the hotel, developed what was called at the time ""Broad Street pneumonia"" (<https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00045731.htm>). Aerosols containing legionella can be generated from contaminated water by cooling towers, fountains, showers, and misting sprays in outdoor event spaces and in grocery departments.

Home and car air-conditioning units do not use water to cool the air, so they are not a risk for legionella growth (<https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/about/causes-transmission.html>).

Eradication of these bacteria from plumbing systems is often difficult. Long-term persistence within these water systems is favored by the intracellular location of legionella within several species of protozoa, where legionella replicate and which provide protection from environmental stressors, like biocides and heat treatment.

Also, the formation of biofilms allows adherence of legionella to the inner surfaces of the plumbing systems (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5835138/>). _Legionella pneumophila_ have been shown to persist for long periods in biofilms in a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state after exposure to a biocide or heat treatment (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515819/>). Monitoring _L. pneumophila_ in water systems, which is usually done by culture, would miss VBNC egionella, which can be revived by the subsequent addition of amoeba (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18839249>).

Debilitated hospitalized patients who are prone to aspiration may develop legionnaires' disease following aspiration of legionella-contaminated potable water as well as inhaling a fine spray (aerosols) from water sources containing legionella. Possible person-to-person transmission has also been described (Correia AM, Goncalves J, Gomes JP, et al: Probable person-to-person transmission of Legionnaires' disease. N Engl J Med. 2016; 374(5): 497-8; <http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356>).

During the epidemiological and environmental investigation for the source of legionella organisms, patients should be prohibited from taking showers and should consume only sterile water until the source has been remediated.

Genotyping the clinical isolates from the cases of legionnaires' disease will help confirm if this is a common source outbreak, if the genotypes match. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of legionella will identify the environmental source for the individual cases. However, if the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping. We have not been told if legionella has been isolated from any environmental water sources or if genotyping has been done on any clinical or environmental legionella isolates.

The news report above offers little information about this outbreak. ""Multiple"" cases of legionnaires' disease have occurred at Ridgeway Manor, but we are not told patient characteristics, how the diagnoses were confirmed, exactly how many cases there are, over what period of time the cases occurred, and if there are any epidemiologic links between the cases, other than residence at Ridgeway Manor. More information on this outbreak from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated. - Mod.ML

.................................................jh/ml/may/sh","DHEC [South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control] is investigating an outbreak at a nursing center in Fairfield County [South Carolina]. The health agency says they are looking into multiple cases of legionnaire's disease at the Ridgeway Manor Healthcare Center.People can catch the infection after breathing in mists from a water source like air conditioning, cooling towers and showers that are contaminated with the bacteria.According to the Pritzker Law Firm, DHEC is working with the nursing center to put preventative measures in place and to find the source of the contamination.[byline: Jessica Mejia]--communicated by:ProMED[Ridgeway Manor Healthcare Center is a skilled nursing, short-term rehabilitation, and 112-bed long-term care facility in Ridgeway, South Carolina, United States (<https://health.usnews.com/best-nursing-homes/area/sc/ridgeway-manor-healthcare-center-425158>). Ridgeway (population 266 residents in 2020) is a town in Fairfield County, 24 miles (39 km) south of the city of Columbia, the state capital (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridgeway,_South_Carolina>).Legionella are Gram negative bacilli that are found in both natural freshwater environments, such as lakes and streams, and in manufactured plumbing systems. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 deg C (77-104 deg F) support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems.Humans usually acquire these organisms by inhalation of aerosolized legionella from contaminated water sources. Aerosols can spread for distances outdoors wafting on air currents downwind from their source. In fact, during the outbreak of pneumonia among legionnaires meeting at a hotel in Philadelphia in 1976 that was subsequently thought to be due to inhalation of aerosolized _Legionella pneumophila_ within the hotel, some passersby on Broad Street in front of the hotel, who had never entered the hotel, developed what was called at the time ""Broad Street pneumonia"" (<https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00045731.htm>). Aerosols containing legionella can be generated from contaminated water by cooling towers, fountains, showers, and misting sprays in outdoor event spaces and in grocery departments.Home and car air-conditioning units do not use water to cool the air, so they are not a risk for legionella growth (<https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/about/causes-transmission.html>).Eradication of these bacteria from plumbing systems is often difficult.

Oysters harvested from a small island city in Florida are associated with a salmonellosis outbreak that has sickened people in 3 states, the state's health agency says. The Florida Department of Health and the state health departments of Georgia and Alabama have detected 8 cases linked with the consumption of raw oysters harvested from Cedar Key, on the north west coast of Florida.

On 24 Feb 2023, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services shut down the shellfish harvesting area in Cedar Key and recalled the wild oysters collected since 16 Dec 2022. There is an elevated risk of getting sick associated with raw oyster consumption, the health agency said, and it warned consumers not to eat the oysters included in the recall.

Eating food contaminated with salmonella can cause salmonellosis, the health agency said. Symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal cramps and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating a contaminated product. Most people recover without treatment, but in rare circumstances the infection can cause more severe illness and require hospitalization, the health agency noted. Older adults, infants, pregnant women and the immunocompromised are at higher risk of developing a severe illness and should seek medical attention if symptoms arise.

Abstract
-------
""Food-borne diseases such as salmonellosis can be attributed, in part, to the consumption of raw oysters. To determine the prevalence of _Salmonella_ spp. in oysters, oysters harvested from 36 US bays (12 each from the West, East, and Gulf coasts in the summer of 2002, and 12 bays, 4 per coast, in the winter of 2002-2003) were tested. _Salmonella_ was isolated from oysters from each coast of the United States, and 7.4% of all oysters tested contained _Salmonella_. Isolation tended to be bay specific, with some bays having a high prevalence of _Salmonella_, while other bays had none. Differences in the percentage of oysters from which _Salmonella_ was isolated were observed between the summer and winter months, with winter numbers much lower probably due to a variety of weather-related events. The vast majority (78 of 101) of _Salmonella_ isolates from oysters were _Salmonella enterica_ serovar Newport, a major human pathogen, confirming the human health hazard of raw oyster consumption. Contrary to previous findings, no relationship was found between the isolation of fecal coliforms and _Salmonella_ from oysters, indicating a necessity for specific monitoring for _Salmonella_ and other pathogens rather than the current reliance on fecal coliform testing.""

Indeed, one of the earliest infectious diseases linked to oysters was _S. enterica_ serotype Typhi, the cause of typhoid fever. Several 19th century reports are:

-----------------------------------------------------------
Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Started: 26 Feb 2023
Confirmed: 28 Feb 2023
Reported: 1 Mar 2023
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence in the country
Causal agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus [HPAI]
Serotype: H5
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

Outbreak location: Mainque, General Roca, Rio Negro
Started: 26 Feb 2023
Epidemiological unit: farm
Animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Birds / 190 000 / 9000 / 9000 / - / - / -

Affected population: The event occurred in a broiler chicken farm with 10 houses that, at the beginning of the event, had around 190 000 broilers at the end of their fattening cycle. On 27 Feb 2023, during inspection, in one of the poultry houses, a mortality rate of around 17% was detected, deaths having occurred the previous day (which represents a daily mortality rate of almost 2% of the production unit). The farmer immediately informed the SENASA (Servicio Nacional de Sanidad y Calidad Agroalimentaria; the National Food Safety and Quality Service), and official attention was given to the suspicion that same day, with quarantine of the premises and sampling for diagnosis. On 28 Feb 2023, a similar mortality was recorded again in the same house. No disease signs were reported in the other houses. That same day (28 Feb 2023) the official SENASA laboratory got positive results for AI type A subtype H5. On 1 Mar 2023, the official outbreak control actions began. All birds were culled and disposed of.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: contact with wild species
Epidemiological comments: The epidemiological situation in the region (South America) concerns the circulation of HPAI virus in wild, backyard and poultry birds since the end of 2022 and in Argentina since February 2023 in wild and backyard birds.

Control measures at event level
To be applied in domestic animals: disinfection, stamping out, surveillance outside the restricted zone, surveillance within the restricted zone, movement control, zoning, official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste, official destruction of animal products

Diagnostic test results

On 2 Mar 2023, the National Service for Food Health and Quality (Servicio Nacional de Sanidad y Calidad Agroalimentaria [SENASA]) confirmed 4 new positive cases of avian influenza (AI) H5: one in poultry (2nd case in the country, the 1st was detected in Río Negro) and one in backyard in the province of Buenos Aires and 2 in the backyard in the province of Córdoba, bringing a total of 30 detections of the disease to date throughout the country.

Of the 13 samples analyzed today [2 Mar 2023] by the SENASA national laboratory, 4 had a positive diagnosis for AI H5: one in poultry in an establishment in the Buenos Aires town of General Alvear and one from a backyard in Las Flores, while the remaining 2 in backyard birds correspond to the Cordoba towns of Laboulaye and Colonia El Arbol.

After confirmation of the cases, agents from the Buenos Aires Norte and Cordoba del SENASA regional centers will carry out the corresponding sanitary actions in the affected properties. In turn, SENASA is working on sanitary and raking actions in all the regions where the findings were made.

Of the nearly 200 notifications analyzed by the SENASA Laboratory to date [2 Mar 2023], there are 30 confirmed cases in wild birds (3), backyard (25) and commercial sector (2) distributed as follows: 15 in Cordoba, 7 in Buenos Aires, 2 in Río Negro, 2 in Santa Fe, 1 in Jujuy, 1 in Neuquen, 1 in San Luis and 1 in Salta.

<https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/01/health/congenital-syphilis-alarming-rise/index.html>


Left untreated, syphilis can lead to stillbirth. It may damage a baby's organs and bones or harm vision and hearing. In 2021, more than 200 infants in the United States with congenital syphilis died. Rates of syphilis in babies are rising at an alarming rate in the United States.

Syphilis is a bacterial infection that is typically spread by sexual contact. It begins with a painless sore called a chancre. These often arise on the genitals or mouth. The disease spreads from person to person through direct contact with these sores. People can have symptoms 10 to 90 days after infection. Syphilis is sometimes called the great pretender because its symptoms can mimic those of many other diseases: fever, sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, hair loss and fatigue.

Without treatment, the infection progresses through a series of stages. It can lie dormant in the body for years or even decades, returning with a vengeance in its later stages to attack the brain, nerves, eyes and other organs. It can lead to deafness, blindness or death. In addition to passing the infection through skin sores, people who are pregnant can pass the infection to a developing baby in the womb. When a baby becomes infected before birth, this is known as congenital syphilis. Public health experts consider congenital syphilis to be a ""never event"" -- something that should never happen -- because nearly every case is preventable.

Timely treatment -- at least 30 days before delivery -- slashes the risk that the infection will pass from mother to baby by 98%, and syphilis is treated with penicillin, one of the world's oldest and cheapest antibiotics (<https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/pregnancy/effects/syphilis.html>). From a public health standpoint, then, stopping this infection should be a no-brainer.

But increasingly, people are falling through the cracks during pregnancy, not getting tested or treated in time to stop transmission from mother to infant. Each case represents ""multiple failures of the health system to identify and treat the mom,"" said Dr Ali Khan, dean of the College of Public Health at the University of Nebraska Medical Center.

Over the past decade, ""there's been about a 700% increase in the cases of congenital syphilis in the United States,"" said Dr Robert McDonald of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Division of STD Prevention, Surveillance and Data Management. ""It really is upsetting, because this is something that is fully preventable if we have the right screening and treatment,"" he said. ""It's out there; people just need to be connected with that.""

Rates of congenital syphilis, meaning the number of cases for every 100 000 live births, are highest in the South and Southwest, in states such as Arizona, New Mexico, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, according to a CNN analysis of CDC data.

Cases in the South have grown the fastest: up 432% between 2016 and 2021, which is the latest year for which complete data are available. Individual states have seen increases that are even more eye-popping. From 2016 to 2021, cases shot up 3300% in Mississippi, nearly 3000% in Oklahoma, more than 2200% in Hawaii, more than 1800% in Washington, more than 1600% in New Mexico, more than 1500% in Wisconsin and more than 1000% in Iowa and Arizona, according to CDC data. Even Maine, which had been one of 3 states to have been free of cases in the past decade or so, reported its 1st congenital syphilis case in 3 decades in January [2023] (<https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/health-advisory.shtml?id=10134153>).

This is a frustrating reversal for the United States, where determined public health efforts and robust contact-tracing programs had driven congenital syphilis cases to almost historically low numbers just a decade ago. In 2012, 324 congenital syphilis cases were reported to the CDC. In 2021, that number had ballooned to 2677 (<https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6444a3.htm>).

The reasons for this increase are complex and intertwined, starting with a lack of funding. At the height of the success of efforts to eradicate congenital syphilis, the government followed what has become a predictable approach when it comes to funding public health. ""When something no longer seems to be a problem, we walk away from it,"" said Elizabeth Finley, communications director for the nonprofit National Coalition of STD Directors.

According to an analysis by the coalition, CDC prevention funding for the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases has fallen more than 40% since 2003, when adjusted for inflation. Next, there's a shortage of qualified personnel. During the COVID-19 pandemic, STD programs were sacrificed in many health departments so their resources -- particularly staffers with much-needed contact tracing experience -- could be diverted to fighting the coronavirus.

One of the main roles of public health programs is messaging, getting the word out. Without staff and resources, awareness has been lacking. Cases of congenital syphilis had become so rare that many doctors no longer recognize the infection. ""For many doctors who may have been training in the 1990s or early 2000s, they may not have seen syphilis,"" McDonald said. ""They may not have learned that much about syphilis because it was on such a decline in the country.""

Then there's the role of Medicaid, which covers almost half of all births in the United States. Rates of syphilis are 6 times higher among Medicaid participants compared with people covered by private insurance and twice as high compared with those who pay their own healthcare costs, according to a recent study by CDC. Although Medicaid requires that all pregnant women be tested for syphilis in their 1st trimester, state policies differ on repeat testing, in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy and at birth.

Even in states that have not expanded eligibility for Medicaid, lower-income pregnant women are usually covered for prenatal care and for at least 2 months after they give birth. But their male partners may not be. States that haven't expanded Medicaid don't cover childless adults who are not disabled, which may make it difficult for men to get primary care. So even if women are diagnosed and treated, their sex partners may not be, increasing the potential for reinfection during pregnancy.

Of 11 states that haven't expanded eligibility for Medicaid, 7 are in the South, the region that has also seen the biggest increases in congenital syphilis in recent years. The demographics of the infection have shifted, too. Once, syphilis was commonest among men who have sex with men, but recently, the infection has become commoner in heterosexual women and their partners.

It seems to be especially common in certain settings: for example, in situations where substance abuse and transactional sex may be involved. Women addicted to methamphetamine seem to be at particular risk. ""We have noticed this in our practice, as well,"" said Dr Deepika Sankaran, a neonatologist and assistant professor at the University of California at Davis who co-authored a recent review on the increase (<https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36712768/>). ""Substance abuse, especially methamphetamine abuse and perinatal syphilis or syphilis in moms, goes hand-in-hand."" That means many women who are at risk of getting syphilis and passing it on to their babies are in vulnerable situations and difficult for healthcare providers to reach.

This story is not unfamiliar to Sankaran, who noticed the same thing at the healthcare center where she works. Many times, she says, pregnant women at high risk for syphilis would come to the ER for care, but doctors there wouldn't think to check for the disease, which doesn't always have obvious symptoms. ""A lot of times, these pregnant moms who may potentially have syphilis, that is the only point of contact. That is our only time we can actually diagnose them, test them and treat them,"" she said. Sankaran says she talked to colleagues in the ER and set up what amounts to a mini syphilis clinic in emergency department of Rideout Regional Medical Center, the community health center where she works in Marysville, California.

Now, she says, every pregnant woman who shows up in the emergency department gets a blood test to screen for syphilis. If it's positive, they get a shot of penicillin before they leave. ""This injection with penicillin is very effective in treating perinatal syphilis and could be helpful in preventing congenital syphilis in the newborn,"" she said.

New Mexico, which has the 2nd-highest rate of congenital syphilis in the United States behind Arizona, has taken a similar approach. The state recently renewed a public health order issued in 2021 that deems all women in the state at high risk of syphilis infection. The order requires doctors to follow best practices outlined by CDC, which include testing all pregnant women for syphilis 3 times: once in the 1st trimester of pregnancy, again in the 3rd trimester and finally at delivery. It also requires doctors to test pregnant women seen in emergency rooms and urgent care centers.

.................................................ml/rd/sh","Left untreated, syphilis can lead to stillbirth. It may damage a baby's organs and bones or harm vision and hearing. In 2021, more than 200 infants in the United States with congenital syphilis died. Rates of syphilis in babies are rising at an alarming rate in the United States.Syphilis is a bacterial infection that is typically spread by sexual contact. It begins with a painless sore called a chancre. These often arise on the genitals or mouth. The disease spreads from person to person through direct contact with these sores. People can have symptoms 10 to 90 days after infection. Syphilis is sometimes called the great pretender because its symptoms can mimic those of many other diseases: fever, sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, hair loss and fatigue.Without treatment, the infection progresses through a series of stages. It can lie dormant in the body for years or even decades, returning with a vengeance in its later stages to attack the brain, nerves, eyes and other organs. It can lead to deafness, blindness or death. In addition to passing the infection through skin sores, people who are pregnant can pass the infection to a developing baby in the womb. When a baby becomes infected before birth, this is known as congenital syphilis. Public health experts consider congenital syphilis to be a ""never event"" -- something that should never happen -- because nearly every case is preventable.Timely treatment -- at least 30 days before delivery -- slashes the risk that the infection will pass from mother to baby by 98%, and syphilis is treated with penicillin, one of the world's oldest and cheapest antibiotics (<https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/pregnancy/effects/syphilis.html>). From a public health standpoint, then, stopping this infection should be a no-brainer.But increasingly, people are falling through the cracks during pregnancy, not getting tested or treated in time to stop transmission from mother to infant. Each case represents ""multiple failures of the health system to identify and treat the mom,"" said Dr Ali Khan, dean of the College of Public Health at the University of Nebraska Medical Center.Over the past decade, ""there's been about a 700% increase in the cases of congenital syphilis in the United States,"" said Dr Robert McDonald of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Division of STD Prevention, Surveillance and Data Management. ""It really is upsetting, because this is something that is fully preventable if we have the right screening and treatment,"" he said. ""It's out there; people just need to be connected with that.""Rates of congenital syphilis, meaning the number of cases for every 100 000 live births, are highest in the South and Southwest, in states such as Arizona, New Mexico, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, according to a CNN analysis of CDC data.Cases in the South have grown the fastest: up 432% between 2016 and 2021, which is the latest year for which complete data are available. Individual states have seen increases that are even more eye-popping. From 2016 to 2021, cases shot up 3300% in Mississippi, nearly 3000% in Oklahoma, more than 2200% in Hawaii, more than 1800% in Washington, more than 1600% in New Mexico, more than 1500% in Wisconsin and more than 1000% in Iowa and Arizona, according to CDC data. Even Maine, which had been one of 3 states to have been free of cases in the past decade or so, reported its 1st congenital syphilis case in 3 decades in January [2023] (<https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/health-advisory.shtml?id=10134153>).This is a frustrating reversal for the United States, where determined public health efforts and robust contact-tracing programs had driven congenital syphilis cases to almost historically low numbers just a decade ago. In 2012, 324 congenital syphilis cases were reported to the CDC. In 2021, that number had ballooned to 2677 (<https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6444a3.htm>).The reasons for this increase are complex and intertwined, starting with a lack of funding. At the height of the success of efforts to eradicate congenital syphilis, the government followed what has become a predictable approach when it comes to funding public health. ""When something no longer seems to be a problem, we walk away from it,"" said Elizabeth Finley, communications director for the nonprofit National Coalition of STD Directors.According to an analysis by the coalition, CDC prevention funding for the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases has fallen more than 40% since 2003, when adjusted for inflation. Next, there's a shortage of qualified personnel. During the COVID-19 pandemic, STD programs were sacrificed in many health departments so their resources -- particularly staffers with much-needed contact tracing experience -- could be diverted to fighting the coronavirus.One of the main roles of public health programs is messaging, getting the word out. Without staff and resources, awareness has been lacking. Cases of congenital syphilis had become so rare that many doctors no longer recognize the infection. ""For many doctors who may have been training in the 1990s or early 2000s, they may not have seen syphilis,"" McDonald said. ""They may not have learned that much about syphilis because it was on such a decline in the country.""Then there's the role of Medicaid, which covers almost half of all births in the United States. Rates of syphilis are 6 times higher among Medicaid participants compared with people covered by private insurance and twice as high compared with those who pay their own healthcare costs, according to a recent study by CDC. Although Medicaid requires that all pregnant women be tested for syphilis in their 1st trimester, state policies differ on repeat testing, in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy and at birth.Even in states that have not expanded eligibility for Medicaid, lower-income pregnant women are usually covered for prenatal care and for at least 2 months after they give birth. But their male partners may not be. States that haven't expanded Medicaid don't cover childless adults who are not disabled, which may make it difficult for men to get primary care. So even if women are diagnosed and treated, their sex partners may not be, increasing the potential for reinfection during pregnancy.Of 11 states that haven't expanded eligibility for Medicaid, 7 are in the South, the region that has also seen the biggest increases in congenital syphilis in recent years. The demographics of the infection have shifted, too. Once, syphilis was commonest among men who have sex with men, but recently, the infection has become commoner in heterosexual women and their partners.It seems to be especially common in certain settings: for example, in situations where substance abuse and transactional sex may be involved. Women addicted to methamphetamine seem to be at particular risk. ""We have noticed this in our practice, as well,"" said Dr Deepika Sankaran, a neonatologist and assistant professor at the University of California at Davis who co-authored a recent review on the increase (<https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36712768/>). ""Substance abuse, especially methamphetamine abuse and perinatal syphilis or syphilis in moms, goes hand-in-hand."" That means many women who are at risk of getting syphilis and passing it on to their babies are in vulnerable situations and difficult for healthcare providers to reach.This story is not unfamiliar to Sankaran, who noticed the same thing at the healthcare center where she works. Many times, she says, pregnant women at high risk for syphilis would come to the ER for care, but doctors there wouldn't think to check for the disease, which doesn't always have obvious symptoms. ""A lot of times, these pregnant moms who may potentially have syphilis, that is the only point of contact. That is our only time we can actually diagnose them, test them and treat them,"" she said. Sankaran says she talked to colleagues in the ER and set up what amounts to a mini syphilis clinic in emergency department of Rideout Regional Medical Center, the community health center where she works in Marysville, California.Now, she says, every pregnant woman who shows up in the emergency department gets a blood test to screen for syphilis. If it's positive, they get a shot of penicillin before they leave. ""This injection with penicillin is very effective in treating perinatal syphilis and could be helpful in preventing congenital syphilis in the newborn,"" she said.New Mexico, which has the 2nd-highest rate of congenital syphilis in the United States behind Arizona, has taken a similar approach. The state recently renewed a public health order issued in 2021 that deems all women in the state at high risk of syphilis infection. The order requires doctors to follow best practices outlined by CDC, which include testing all pregnant women for syphilis 3 times: once in the 1st trimester of pregnancy, again in the 3rd trimester and finally at delivery. It also requires doctors to test pregnant women seen in emergency rooms and urgent care centers.[byline: Brenda Goodman and Deidre McPhillips]--communicated by:ProMED[A discussion of congenital syphilis in the United States can be found in my moderator comments in a prior ProMED post Syphilis - USA (03): (OK) congenital, increasing cases, RFI 20230223.8708550. - Mod.MLProMED map:United States: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8708710,106>]",CNN,,

Central District Health (CDH), Idaho, has declared an outbreak of syphilis in Public Health District 4, according to a recent news release. CDH says it identified 52 syphilis infections in Ada, Boise, Elmore, and Valley counties and reports 168 cases of syphilis infections since 1 Jan 2022 in persons aged 15 to 87. The number of reported cases of syphilis increased in 2022 and continues to grow in 2023.

""The rapid increase in syphilis infections highlights the need for heightened awareness of the potential for syphilis transmission among all ages and populations,"" says CDH staff epidemiologist Jessica McClenahan. ""Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) that can have serious health consequences if left undetected and untreated.""

Symptoms of syphilis include sores, rash, fever, and swollen lymph nodes. Some people with syphilis experience no symptoms. If left untreated, syphilis can cause vision or hearing loss as well as other neurological complications.

CDH adds that pregnant individuals should consider the risk of congenital syphilis: when a pregnant person with syphilis passes the infection to the unborn baby. Congenital syphilis can result in stillbirth, early infant death, or long-term health problems for the child. Pregnant individuals should be screened for syphilis at their first prenatal appointment and potentially again before delivery.

CDH recommends safer sexual practices, regular testing for STIs, and rapid treatment for infection as important parts of maintaining overall health and well-being. More information about risk reduction strategies is available from your medical providers or at <https://www.cdc.gov/std/prevention/>.

One woman died of Nipah virus in Rajshahi Medical College Hospital (RMCH) on Wednesday afternoon [1 Mar 2023]. The deceased, aged 25, was admitted to the neuro medicine ward of RMCH with common symptoms like fever and seizures. Complications escalated after she was diagnosed with Nipah virus on Wednesday morning [1 Mar 2023] and was eventually referred to Nipah intensive care unit. She died around 5 pm while undergoing treatment.

Her mother-in-law [has been] admitted [to] the Nipah Suspect Ward with the same symptoms, [and her] father-in-law died at home with the same symptoms 2 weeks ago.

Although the family thinks it was a natural death, doctors believe that her father-in-law was also infected with Nipah virus. It has been reported that their entire family consumes date juice without boiling it, a common cause of the spread of this disease.

Dr Azizul Haque, medicine specialist at Rajshahi Medical College Hospital, said: ""Relatives of deceased patients are at higher risk of infection. So, they need to be extra careful. We are working in coordination with IEDCR."" He urged people to be careful while drinking date juice.

However, Rajshahi civil surgeon Dr Abu Yusuf Mohammad Farooq said that there is no need for regular care of the patient's relatives. The IECCR has collected and tested the samples of everyone who came in contact with the infected patient. However, everyone should be careful while drinking date juice.

A total of 5 people have died in Rajshahi Medical College Hospital (RMCH) so far. All of them have a history of drinking date palm juice. Besides, everyone was admitted to the general ward of the hospital with common symptoms like jaundice. Then suddenly the physical condition started to deteriorate. The death occurred on admission to the ICU. Nipah [infection] of one of the deceased was identified after death.

It has been reported that their entire family consumes date juice without boiling it, a common cause of the spread of this disease.Dr Azizul Haque, medicine specialist at Rajshahi Medical College Hospital, said: ""Relatives of deceased patients are at higher risk of infection. So, they need to be extra careful. We are working in coordination with IEDCR."" He urged people to be careful while drinking date juice.However, Rajshahi civil surgeon Dr Abu Yusuf Mohammad Farooq said that there is no need for regular care of the patient's relatives. The IECCR has collected and tested the samples of everyone who came in contact with the infected patient. However, everyone should be careful while drinking date juice.A total of 5 people have died in Rajshahi Medical College Hospital (RMCH) so far. All of them have a history of drinking date palm juice. Besides, everyone was admitted to the general ward of the hospital with common symptoms like jaundice. Then suddenly the physical condition started to deteriorate. The death occurred on admission to the ICU. Nipah [infection] of one of the deceased was identified after death.[byline: Abdullah Al Dulal]--communicated by:ProMED from HealthMap Alerts[This may have been a familial cluster of Nipah virus infections. The young woman was a diagnosed case and her mother-in law and father-in-law were suspected cases but not confirmed. All had a history of consuming raw (uncooked) date palm sap, the likely source of the virus. However, person to person transmission can occur and cannot be ruled out in this situation.The previous ProMED post provides more details on cases so far this year (2023) than were in the previous ProMED posts.

The minister of agriculture, Eng Khaled Al-Hanifat, confirmed that the local milk production has now recovered, after the decrease in the quantities of milk resulting from the effects of foot and mouth disease [FMD]. Al-Hanifat expects regular production of cow milk in the coming months, to meet market needs.

Al-Hanifat chaired a coordination meeting on Tuesday [28 Feb 2023]  to study the decrease in the quantities of milk resulting from the effects of FMD, which affected the dairy manufacturing sector and caused some decrease in quantities, according to information from manufacturers. Such decrease may affect the availability of the product during the coming weeks, especially for the holy month of Ramadan [2023]. The meeting was attended by representatives/directors of several related agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration, the Ministry of Industry and Trade, the Amman Chamber of Industry, the Institution for Standards and Metrology, and a number of dairy companies.

The participants discussed the possibility of using limited quantities of powdered milk to cover the needs of the market and a temporary amendment of the specification for some products in the event of a future market need.

[According to an earlier (19 Feb 2023, <https://royanews.tv/news/294822>) media report, dairy cattle farms in Jordan produce 400 tons (363 tonnes) of milk daily. This amount was normal before the spread of FMD, which reduced the volume of production to 250 tons (227 tonnes), a loss rate of 30% due to the disease. According to Ali Ghabayen, head of the Cattle Breeders Association, more than 90% of cow farms in Jordan were affected by FMD. According to him, the total losses of cow farms across the Kingdom were about 35 million dinars (about USD 49.3 million). This is composed mainly of the milk production losses and the death of more than 1350 head of cows and calves. Farms in Al Halabat and Al Dhelil constitute 60% of the total milk produced in Jordan, distributed to dairy and cheese factories. As a result of the disease, the production rate decreased by half. - Mod.AS]

The Ministry of Agriculture has published the daily foot and mouth disease report, noting the results of the work based on the actions taken by the working committee. The statement, a copy of which was received by Roya, stated that, based on the measures taken by the committees working within the FMD file, the results of the work were as follows: 

1st: The infection index decreased to zero for 2 days in a row in the focus of infection, with the spread stopping outside the affected farms.

2nd: The continued recovery in the quantities of milk within the focus of infection, with a noticeable and continuous increase, confirming the availability of appropriate quantities for manufacturing.

3rd: The end of the work of the Committee for the Inventory of Damage related to Mortality in the field, as of this evening, Sunday [26 Feb 2023], and considering today [26 Feb 2023] as the last day to receive the forms, with the continuation of audit and analysis procedures.

4th: The results of the report issued by the committee formed by the Animal Health Organization, which included Italian experts and headed by the Regional Director of the Animal Health Organization, are as follows:
- The new strain of SAT2 virus is genetically identical to the strain currently present in Iraq, and it may have been transmitted by several means, including fodder that was imported exclusively for the Cattle Breeders Association.

5th: It was decided to open livestock markets in all governorates of the Kingdom, with the exception of Zarqa and Mafraq, as of Monday morning [27 Feb 2023], for the trade of sheep and goats, with the exception of the trading of cows and calves.

[Following the publication of the above statement by Jordan's Ministry of Agriculture, declaring the FMDV SAT-2 event resolved, Jordan's Veterinarian Association submitted, on 27 Feb 2023, its response ""on the reality of FMD in Jordan"". The statement, published in the Al Ghad newspaper on the same date, is available (in Arabic) at <https://tinyurl.com/2p9f344p>. 

Among several issues raised by the syndicate, we present here the following (summarised) 3 issues: 
1. The syndicate argues that disease, death and losses are continuing according to the observation of practitioners in the field.

2. The feed from Iraq, referred to by the ministry as one of the possible means of virus introduction, was -- according to the syndicate's information -- not imported specifically for the Cattle Breeders Association (limiting infection to the dairy cattle cluster in the Dhlail region, Zarqa), but was sold to all farms in the Kingdom.

3. The origin, route of introduction, and chronology of the event should be clarified. To this end, they request the publication of the full genotyping report(s) from the labs allowing assessment of virus history, chronology, and geography.

Jordan's News Agency (Petra), published on 5 Feb 2023 that the results of the FMD virus analysis at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine/University of Science and Technology, Irbid, revealed the emergence of a new strain of the virus called SAT-2, ""which was not previously registered in Jordan."" The ministry added in a statement that this strain was registered in Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Ethiopia, indicating that ""the results of the analysis were verified by Pirbright"" (<https://tinyurl.com/28ax5vuv>).

So far, FMDV SAT-2 is not available among the ""samples tested"" reports presented on Jordan's page of the WRLFMD at Pirbright (<https://www.wrlfmd.org/western-and-central-asia/jordan#panel-9742>). Notably, the reference laboratory publishes results only after obtaining the consent of the relevant country to do so.

Similarly, the results of FMDV SAT-2 samples from Iraq are not (yet) presented on Iraq's page (<https://www.wrlfmd.org/western-and-central-asia/iraq#panel-7312>). Iraq reported 9 new outbreaks on 26 Feb 2023, spread throughout the country (follow-up-report No 5). - Mod.AS

Observing that there was no evidence of a viral epidemic at present, the West Bengal government has stated that there were only 12 deaths in government hospitals due to adenovirus infection. ""There were only 12 deaths in government hospitals due to adenovirus and out of the same 8 cases were having severe comorbidities,"" its press statement said.

The statement by the state government comes after several deaths of children due to adenovirus infection were reported in hospitals of Kolkata and district. On 1 Mar 2023, the state's health secretary Narayan Swarup Nigam visited different state-run hospitals in Kolkata. ""There is no evidence of a viral epidemic at present. The current situation is nothing but a seasonal surge and the number of infections due to adenovirus have already started coming down. This infection can affect any age group, but younger children with comorbidities like congenital heart disease, severe malnutrition, etc. are at a higher risk requiring medical attention,"" the statement issued on Wednesday evening [1 Mar 2023] pointed out.

According to the state government, 5213 cases of acute respiratory infection (ARI) were reported in the state in the past month. The current situation is nothing but a seasonal surge and the number of infections due to adenovirus have already started coming down, the government said. Family members of children suffering from ARI have complained about lack of beds in government hospitals.

""There are more than 5000 beds in 121 hospitals in the state having facilities for management of paediatric ARI, with 600 paediatricians in position. There are 2476 SNCU (sick newborn care units) beds, 654 PICU [pediatric intensive care unit] beds and 120 NICU [neonatal intensive care unit] beds across the State. Number of beds dedicated to attend paediatric ARI are further being increased as per the situation,"" the press statement said.

The state health department has circulated a standard case management guideline to all medical establishments and control rooms have been set up to monitor the situation on a round the clock basis.

<https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2023/mar/02/kolkata-adenovirus-claims-lives-of-10-children-in-48hours-2552184.html>


A total of 10 children -- newborn to 3 years old -- with symptoms of adenovirus infection died in the past 48 hours at hospitals in Kolkata and Bankura. With this, the number of deaths due to the virus-borne [sic: ""viral"" would be the correct adjective. - Mod.SH] disease in Bengal has gone up to 45 in the past 2 months.

Following this, the state health department has issued advisories ensuring the presence of pediatricians in government hospitals round-the-clock. A helpline number has been announced. People can call the round-the-clock helpline number for admission-related and other inquiries.

On Wednesday [1 Mar 2023], 4 children died in Kolkata's 2 hospitals and 2 others in Bankura Medical College and Hospital.

Flooded with children coming from districts, the state health department advised that no child with a respiratory ailment can be referred to a hospital in Kolkata without ensuring that a bed is booked at the destination healthcare facility. The referral, if needed, must be done with the knowledge of the superintendent of the hospital.

The state government asked all medical colleges, district hospitals, sub-divisional hospitals and state general hospitals across Bengal to run separate clinics for children with an acute respiratory infection (ARI) in the paediatric outpatient department [OPD]. The special clinics will be meant for those with respiratory illnesses so they do not have to wait in the OPD queue with other patients.

A doctor at a hospital said the current spate of viral attacks was causing immune dysregulation which disrupts the normal immune system and makes children vulnerable to reinfection. ""The inflammatory process that is being triggered inside the body to kill live viruses is creating some problems which we call dysregulated immunity. The initiation of the inflammatory process is helping the child recover from the initial infection but leads to some other problems. We have noticed that some children are falling sick again after being discharged from the hospital. We have asked experts to examine the reason behind it,'' said an official of the health department.

Four children died due to respiratory infections at different hospitals in Kolkata within 24 hours on Wednesday [1 Mar 2023], amidst fears of an adenovirus outbreak. Two deaths were reported at the Dr B C Roy Post Graduate Institute of Paediatric Sciences while 2 deaths were reported at the Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital (MCH). This comes a day after the deaths of 5 children were reported across hospitals in Kolkata.

As the number of children with respiratory distress is rising in the hospitals across West Bengal's capital and adjoining districts, the state's health secretary Narayan Swarup Nigam visited hospitals in the city and announced that the number paediatric beds would be augmented. However, he added that most of the children who died had been suffering from ""co-morbidities"".

""Several of these cases had co-morbidities. These are children who are born underweight or had heart related issues,"" Mr Nigam said. The health secretary said that he had held discussions with hospital authorities and doctors, who were confident about the treatment and infrastructure available. The official also added that district hospitals would have to speak to the superintendent of the medical college and hospitals for referral of patients.

A father whose child died at the B C Roy Hospital alleged that 3 children were put on a single bed at the hospital and added that the authorities had misbehaved with him. On Tuesday [28 Feb 2023], the West Bengal Health Department said, ""All paediatric acute respiratory infection (ARI) clinics will operate at the medical college and hospitals (MCHs), district hospitals and sub-divisional hospitals, among others, round the clock... No paediatric ARI cases shall be referred without the knowledge of the concerned MSVP/Superintendent of the hospital.""

There are reports of the deaths of children due to respiratory distress in the districts, where hospitals are also struggling with influx of patients. Five paediatric hubs -- B C Roy Post Graduate Institute of Paediatric Sciences, Calcutta National MCH , North Bengal MCH, Bankura Sammilani MCH and Malda MCH, which were prepared to deal with such situations during the pandemic -- will supervise the multiple secondary hospitals.

Adenoviruses can cause a wide range of illnesses including common cold or flu-like symptoms. People with weakened immune systems, particularly children, are at higher risk.

[As noted in our earlier report, Adenovirus types 3 and 7 were both found circulating in the area and are associated with respiratory disease, with type 7 in particular causing more severe disease outcomes. Co-morbidities only increase the risk. The 3 reports above also paint a somewhat contrasting picture in that case counts may be going down from their seasonal highs, yet hospitals are still seeing large numbers of acute respiratory illnesses. One wonders if this is being compounded by co-circulation of other respiratory pathogens like seasonal influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and/or COVID-19 (similar to the ""tripledemic"" that hit large parts of the US in the fall of 2022). - Mod.JH

A woman in eastern China has tested positive for [Influenza A] H5N1 bird flu, the strain of avian influenza which has spread around the world and worried experts. The news comes just a week after 2 people in Cambodia were infected with a similar variant.

The latest case is a 53 year old woman from Jiangsu province in eastern China, according to WHO. She developed symptoms on 31 Jan 2023 after exposure to poultry. Details about her condition have not been released.

Genetic sequencing carried out in China showed that the new case was caused by clade 2.3.4.4b, the same variant which has spread around the world and raised concern about a possible threat to human health. This sets it apart from the cases in Cambodia, which were caused by clade 2.3.2.1c, an older variant.

The new variant of H5N1, which emerged in late 2021, has caused outbreaks around the world, even in countries where bird flu had never been found. Since then, more than 200 million birds have either died or been culled, most of them in Europe and the US. The global spread of bird flu has raised concern about the possibility of a future variant which could lead to human-to-human transmission. Recent cases in mammals -- including in mink, foxes and sea lions -- have added to those concerns.

""The global H5N1 situation is worrying given the wide spread of the virus in birds around the world and the increasing reports of cases in mammals, including in humans,"" Dr Sylvie Briand, a WHO official, said on Friday [24 Feb 2023]. ""WHO takes the risk from this virus seriously and urges heightened vigilance from all countries.""

The World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) echoed those concerns. ""The current situation highlights the risk that H5N1 avian influenza may become better adapted to mammals and spill over to humans and other animals,"" the agency said on 13 Feb 2023. ""Some animals, such as mink, may act as mixing vessels for different influenza viruses, leading to the emergence of new strains and subtypes that could be more harmful to animals and/or humans.""

A 9 year old girl in Ecuador tested positive for H5N1 bird flu in January 2023, making it the 1st such case in South America. She was hospitalized in critical condition but has since recovered. In September 2022, a 38 year old woman died of H5N1 in China's Guangxi after exposure to backyard poultry.

[This adds yet another case to the slow trickle of human avian influenza cases across the globe. As noted in yesterday's H5N6 update (20230302.8708673) the FluTracker website has a more exhaustive list of human avian influenza cases. As with virtually all of the human avian influenza cases of late, the primary factor is close contact with poultry and/or wild birds. Mitigating spillover to humans will require a multi-faceted approach and is only compounded in difficulty by the sheer number of global avian influenza infections we've seen in the past few months across a multitude of species. - Mod.JH

EHV-1 in Ontario boarding barn
------------------------------
A 21 year old mare in Simcoe County, Ontario, is positive for EHV-1. The mare developed mild ataxia on 22 Feb 2023. The day before [21 Feb 2023], a paddock mate developed signs of vestibular disease, including head tilt, nystagmus and ataxia, as well as urinary incontinence. Both horses were referred to an equine hospital on 22 Feb 2023. Test results for the horse with vestibular disease are still pending, but EHV-1 is suspected to be the cause. The horses are affected and alive.

The horses reside at a boarding facility, where 38 horses are now exposed. The facility owner has implemented voluntary movement restrictions and biosecurity measures under the supervision of the attending veterinarian.

EHM outbreak in Montana
-----------------------
Three horses in Flathead County, Montana, tested positive for equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM), and 2 additional cases are suspected. The horses are spread across 3 different barns and developed neurological signs. So far, 4 of the confirmed and suspected cases have been euthanized due to the severity of disease. The 5th is displaying mild clinical signs and is under quarantine. Exposed horses from the affected premises are also subject to quarantine for 21 days beyond the last date of potential exposure.

Several of the affected horses had no travel history. However, herd mates, who are not displaying clinical signs, had attended events at 2 or more event centers in the area where they were exposed. Those horses are likely contributing to the disease spread at their home locations and other equine events.

Now, the Montana Department of Livestock is recommending horse owners and event coordinators in the Flathead Valley limit travel and cancel events bringing horses from multiple sources together through 6 Feb 2023. If additional cases are detected, this date will be extended.

Horse owners who have attended events in the Flathead Valley in recent weeks should monitor their animals for fever or development of neurological signs for 2 weeks after their last travel.

Texas: equine herpes virus confirmed in Hood County horse
---------------------------------------------------------
The Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) received confirmation of equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM), the neurologic disease linked to equine herpes virus (EHV-1), in a Hood County Quarter Horse on 9 Feb 2023. This is the 1st positive detection of EHM in Texas this year [2023].

The horse was tested after showing neurologic signs, including poor muscle control in the hind limbs. The local veterinary clinic immediately placed the horse in an isolated quarantine where it remains throughout treatment. The premises of origin has been quarantined and TAHC staff are working closely with the owner and local veterinarian to monitor other horses and enforce biosecurity measures on the premises.
 
The EHM positive horse attended the National Western Stock Show rodeo event in Denver, Colorado on 20 to 21 Jan 2023, and returned to its premises of origin following the event. The horse has not visited any other events which would expose additional equine. The Colorado State Veterinarian was contacted about this case.

Owners of horses attending the event should work with their veterinary practitioner to establish appropriate monitoring and diagnostic plans and are encouraged to take the following precautions: 
- Clean and disinfect tack, boots, equipment, and grooming supplies.
- When you return to your farm, isolate the horses having attended the event for at least 2 weeks.
- Have their temperatures monitored twice daily for at least 14 days after last known exposure. If a fever or other signs consistent with EHM develop, contact your veterinarian.
- When doing feeding and chores, work with the returning horses last, wear boots and coveralls, and remove them before working with your other horses.
- Don't forget to wash your hands.
 
EHM is a neurologic disease of horses linked to the equine herpes virus. Clinical signs of EHM in horses may include: fever of 102°F [38.89 deg C] or greater (fever most often comes before neurologic signs), nasal discharge, lack of coordination, hindquarter weakness, leaning or resting against a fence or wall to maintain balance, lethargy, urine dribbling, head tilt, diminished tail tone, and penile paralysis.

EHV-1 confirmed at Turf Paradise racetrack
------------------------------------------
A 14 year old thoroughbred gelding at the Turf Paradise racetrack in Maricopa County, Arizona, has tested positive for EHV-1 variant D752. The horse developed clinical signs on 14 Feb 2023 including hindlimb ataxia, weakness, difficulty rising and difficulty maintaining a standing posture. His positive test results were reported on 18 Feb 2023. The horse is now recovering.

Thirty-six horses from Barns C9 and C8W were immediately placed under quarantine. Turf Paradise has restricted movement from the backside until further notice. Biosecurity measures have been implemented for all horses in the quarantined barns, including twice-daily temperature monitoring, movement restriction and area disinfection.

A 4 year old racehorse filly from Barn K6 also developed clinical signs, including depressed attitude, fever and leaning on the stall wall. The filly had raced on 18 Feb 2023 and was claimed from barn D9. She was referred to an equine hospital in the Phoenix area. Barns K6 and K5E were also placed under quarantine, but the filly's test results came back negative for EHV-1.

Idaho horse aborts pregnancy due to EHV-1
-----------------------------------------
A mare at a private facility in Gem County, Idaho, aborted a pregnancy in late February [2023]. On 27 Feb 2023 it was confirmed the abortion was caused by EHV-1 (wild-type) infection, despite all horses on the property being current on all recommended vaccinations.

In recent weeks, several other mares on the property also gave birth to weak foals or experienced unexpected pregnancy loss. EHV-1 diagnosis has not been confirmed in these horses. None of the horses on the property have left or arrived at the premises recently.

In total, 6 horses are suspected positive for EHV-1, and 25 horses are exposed. The affected horses are under voluntary quarantine.

[The vaccine for EHV-1 does tend to decrease the severity of the neurological signs, but thus far there is no vaccine preventing the neurological form of the disease.

Horse owners are encouraged to vaccinate their animals against EHV and use other core vaccines, such as those for eastern and western equine encephalitis (EEE, WEE), West Nile virus (WNV), tetanus, and rabies. Most of these are annual vaccines, except EEE, which needs revaccination approximately every 3-4 months in areas where the disease is prevalent.

[A 13 Dec 2022 report indicated that India had 23 confirmed mpox cases up to 8 Dec 2022 (<https://www.udayavani.com/english-news/23-monkeypox-cases-reported-in-india-till-dec-8-this-year-mos-for-health-bharati-pravin-pawar>). The 23 case total is not yet reflected in the report above. - Mod.TY

Since the last published report there has been a total of 305 new cases and 9 new deaths. The majority of these cases seem to be coming from Central and South America, making up 230 of the newly reported cases worldwide. However, when looking at the number of deaths, the USA contributes 6 of the 9 total reported mpox deaths this week. Further research could be done to look at the factors that contributed to these patient deaths. Multiple studies have shown that those with AIDS or other immune disorders are most susceptible, but understanding what other factors are contributing to severe mpox outcomes would be extremely useful to ensure those at highest risk are aggressively screened and treated. - Mods.CS/JH]

[3] Taiwan: First two cases of locally acquired mpox

First two cases of locally acquired mpox reported
------------------------------------------------
KAOHSIUNG, HSINCHU: Taiwan's first two cases of locally acquired mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) were reported yesterday (Wed 1 Mar 2023 )as the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) warned that the risk of local infection has increased. CDC Epidemic Intelligence Center deputy director Guo Hung-wei said the two cases are a man in his 40s in Hsinchu and a man in his 20s in Kaohsiung. They had symptoms including a fever, papules, blisters and swollen lymph nodes, and were diagnosed with mpox on Sunday and Monday, Guo said.

Neither man had traveled abroad recently, so they have been counted as local cases, Guo said, adding that since June 23 last year, when mpox was made a Category 2 notifiable communicable disease, seven cases have been reported, with the previous five cases being imported.
The global mpox situation has been slowing, with World Health Organization's analysis of recent cases showing that the majority were young men, with 68.8 per cent of transmission occurring through sexual contact.

WHO on 15 Feb 2023 said that mpox would remain a ""public health emergency of international concern"". In November last year WHO said that following ""a series of consultations with global experts, WHO will begin using a new preferred term 'mpox' as a synonym for monkeypox"" and that ""both names will be used simultaneously for one year while 'monkeypox' is phased out"".

CDC deputy director-general Philip Lo said that no connections had been found between the two local cases and 25 close contacts had been identified, including four family members and two intimate contacts. The condition of the two men would be monitored until 20 March 2023, Lo said.

CDC Division of Chronic Diseases head Chan Pei-chun said that mpox is a viral zoonotic disease that has become more transmissible among humans than avian flu. It is mainly spread through intimate contact with an infected person through bodily fluids, respiratory droplets, lesions or contaminated objects, Chan said. Rashes often start on the face or genital area and can spread to other parts of the body, with phases including spots, blisters and scabbing, she said. People with suspected mpox symptoms should wear a mask and wash their hands before seeking medical attention, she said, adding that they should inform their doctor about their recent travel history and contact with suspected cases. As local cases have been reported, people should take extra precautions in high-risk locations, such as where they might have intimate contact with unfamiliar people.

Asian nations, including Japan and Thailand, have also recently reported local mpox cases, suggesting that a rise in international travel as COVID-19 restrictions have been eased globally has allowed mpox to spread more easily across borders, Lo said. The CDC would convene an expert panel to discuss a program of pre-exposure mpox vaccination and communicate with civic groups about prevention among high-risk groups.

Speaking on other health matters, Guo said that cases of infectious diseases reported last week included four new serious flu complications and a high level of diarrhea cases, while enterovirus cases are expected to gradually increase.

Abstract
--------
We report a case of occupational mpox virus infection from a needlestick injury in a healthcare worker in South Korea and review similar reports in the literature during 2022. Postexposure prophylactic treatment with a 3rd-generation smallpox vaccine and antiviral agent tecovirimat inhibited local virus spread and alleviated lesion pain.

[5] Longitudinal mpox virus surface sampling
Date: Thu 23 Feb 2023

<https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2023.02.007>


We read with interest the report from Mellon [and colleagues] regarding air sampling for mpox (formerly monkeypox) virus (MPXV) in an outpatient setting and the need for additional data to assess the risk to healthcare workers (HCWs). In August 2022, we performed longitudinal surface sampling at a large sexual health clinic in London, UK, to investigate environmental contamination of a typical outpatient setting where patients with mpox are assessed. During the 4-week period of observation, a total of 85 patients were seen at the clinic that were subsequently diagnosed with mpox based on samples collected during their visit (number of patients confirmed positive seen in 7 days prior sampling: Week 1 = 31 cases, Week 2 = 26 cases, Week 3 = 22 cases, Week 4 = 6 cases). Weekly sampling was performed in the same observation room using Copan UTM swabs with qPCR analysis performed as previously described. Samples were collected from the same 8 locations each week: HCW desk, HCW keyboard, patient chair armrest, floor beneath patient chair, desk between patient and HCW, wall next to examination table (approximately where the patient head will be facing during examination), floor beneath examination table, and the door handle to exit the examination room.

qPCR analysis of the 32 samples collected (8 samples collected weekly for 4 weeks) resulted in only 3 MPXV positive samples all with crossing threshold (Ct) values near the limit of detection for the assay, indicating occasional low-level contamination of the sampled environment. All 3 positive samples were collected from the floor of the examination room; viral isolation using previously described methods detected replicating virus in one sample collected from the floor beneath the examination table (week 2) confirming the presence of infection-competent MPXV in this sample.

Two of the 3 positive samples were identified in the same location on consecutive weeks raising the possibility of duplicate identification. While our data cannot exclude this possibility, surfaces were thoroughly cleaned using disinfectant wipes (Spill Wipes, Clinell) and the floor cleaned with chlorine solution (Chlor-clean, Guest Medical) after each examination of a suspected mpox case, in addition to routine cleaning performed at the end of every working day.

Despite a significant potential for mpox transmission in healthcare settings, few cases of mpox have been reported in HCWs with just 5 cases recorded by WHO as occupational exposures in Europe through January 2023. Infection prevention and control (IPC) measures including the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) may explain, in part, the very small number of occupationally associated infections reported. The PPE recommended for typical UK outpatient consultations (gloves, fluid-repellent surgical mask, apron, and eye protection if splash risk) is simpler than the recommended PPE for UK HCWs caring for patients with mpox admitted to hospital (gloves, fit-tested FFP3 respirator, long-sleeved fluid-repellent gown, eye protection). ... At present, infectious virus has not been detected in air samples and the risk of establishing human mpox infection via the respiratory route is unknown. The absence of numerous cases in HCWs working in outpatient settings suggests that either i) infectious virus in respiratory secretions is rarely present at sufficient titre to establish infection, ii) respiratory transmission of Clade IIb MPXV is not an optimal route of transmission, or iii) that surgical/FFP2 masks are sufficient to mitigate the residual risks of i) and ii).

We have shown that surface contamination occurs in an outpatient setting and, while it was minimal in the environment sampled, infection-competent MPXV could be detected. It is likely that several factors contribute to the low level of contamination observed including minimal time spent in this locality and the frequency of cleaning. Such focussed surface deposition of virus would not be expected if there had been aerosolisation of virus. Thus in future studies, and where feasible, combined surface- and air-sampling may provide additional insights.

It is feasible that the contamination observed could present an infection risk in specific situations; however, UK PPE recommendations combined with frequent standard cleaning procedures appear sufficient to mitigate onward transmission risk in outpatient settings. IPC recommendations should be kept under review as more data emerge regarding infectious virus in respiratory secretions and the risk of respiratory transmission of MPXV.

[Articles like this remind us why proper PPE and cleaning protocols continue to be the cornerstone of preventing the spread of disease. With the current discussion around mpox spread focused primarily on its potential classification as an STI, this article provides evidence for spread outside of that limited scope. As the authors stated, clearly there is a need for further research on how to better provide revisions and updates in cleaning protocols to ensure that surfaces are properly sanitized. - Mod.CS]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
Background
An unprecedented global mpox outbreak started in May 2022. No data are yet available about the dynamics of the immune response against mpox virus. The aim of this study was to describe kinetics of T-cell response, inflammatory profile, and pox-specific T-cell induction in patients with laboratory-confirmed mpox.

Methods
17 patients with laboratory-confirmed mpox admitted at the Lazzaro Spallanzani National Institute for Infectious Diseases (Rome, Italy), from 19 May-7 Jul 2022, were tested for differentiation and activation profile of CD4 and CD8 T (expression of CD38, PD-1, and CD57 assessed by flow cytometry), frequency of pox-specific T cells (by standard interferon-γ ELISpot), and release of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in plasma (by ELISA). All patients were tested 10-12 days after symptom onset. In a subgroup of 9 patients with a laboratory-confirmed mpox, the kinetics of the immune response were analysed longitudinally according to timing from symptom onset and compared with 10 healthy donors (i.e., healthcare workers recruited from the same institution).

Findings
Among the 17 patients, 10 were HIV negative and 7 HIV positive, all with good viro-immunological status. On days 0-3 from symptom onset, patients with laboratory-confirmed monkeypox were characterised by a statistically significant reduction in CD4+ T cells (p = 0·0011) and a concurrent increase of CD8+ T cells (p = 0·0057) compared with healthy donors. A lower proportion of naive (CD45RA+CD27+) CD4+ T cells was observed in 6 (67%) of 9 patients and a concomitant higher proportion of effector memory (CD45RA-CD27-) CD4+ T cells in all patients; this skewed immune profile tended to normalise over time. A similar differentiated profile was also observed in CD8+ T cells with a consistent expansion of terminally differentiated CD8+ T cells. Patients with monkeypox had a higher proportion of CD4+CD38+ and CD38+CD8+ T-cells than healthy donors, which normalised after 12-20 days from symptom onset. The expression of PD-1 and CD57 on CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells showed kinetics similar to that observed for CD38. Furthermore, the inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF) were higher in patients with monkeypox than in healthy donors and, although they decreased over time, they remained elevated after recovery. Almost all patients (15 [94%] of 16) developed a pox-specific Th1 response. No differences in immune cells profile were observed between patients with and without HIV, whereas paucysimptomatic patients (without systemic symptoms, with less than 5 skin lesions, and no other mucosal localisation of mpox) showed a less perturbed immune profile early after symptom onset.

Interpretation
Our data showed the immunological signature of mpox virus infection, characterised by an early expansion of activated effector CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that persisted over time. Almost all patients, even regardless of HIV infection, developed a poxvirus-specific Th1 cell response. These results might have implications on the expected immunogenicity of mpox vaccination, suggesting that it might not be necessary to vaccinate people who have already been infected.

[The findings of the article in item 5 above provide evidence that can help inform best practice for mpox vaccine allocation moving forward. Further application of the broader immunologic findings could help scientists to identify areas where mpox is endemic or in patients who are not considered ""high risk"" resulting in a misdiagnosis. - Mod.CS]

These results might have implications on the expected immunogenicity of mpox vaccination, suggesting that it might not be necessary to vaccinate people who have already been infected.--communicated by:ProMED[The findings of the article in item 5 above provide evidence that can help inform best practice for mpox vaccine allocation moving forward. Further application of the broader immunologic findings could help scientists to identify areas where mpox is endemic or in patients who are not considered ""high risk"" resulting in a misdiagnosis. - Mod.CS]","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), The Lancet Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), The Journal of Hospital Infection, Taipei Times",,

Chile - influenza A viruses of high pathogenicity (non-poultry including wild birds)
-----------------------------------------------------
Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Started: 10 Feb 2023
Confirmed: 16 Feb 2023
Reported: 24 Feb 2023
Reason for notification: unusual host species
Causal agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus [HPAI]
Serotype: H5N1 [see epidemiological comments]
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

Outbreak location: Playa El Huascar, Antofagasta
Started: 10 Feb 2023
Epidemiological unit: other
Animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
South American sea lion / - / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: contact with wild species
Epidemiological comments: this is the 1st detection of avian influenza H5N1 in an unusual host in the national territory (marine mammal); sea lion _Otaria flavescens_ is the affected species. Regarding organization, the National Directorate of the National Fisheries and Aquaculture Service (El Servicio Nacional de Pesca y Acuicultura; SERNAPESCA) carries out the risk assessment and defines the actions to be implemented in each zone; regional directorates are responsible for implementing these measures. To date, the agent has not been detected in other marine mammals. Following the 1st detection of the pathogen, and based on the location where the affected animal got stranded, a disease control zone was defined along the coastline, where notification of stranded animals is reinforced with sectoral users and clinical and molecular surveillance is implemented in animals with signs and symptoms consistent with highly pathogenic avian influenza, aimed at the early detection and timely control of the spread of the virus. In geographic areas that are not within this zone, passive surveillance will be maintained, focusing on the follow-up of reports.

Control measures applied at event level, wild animals: surveillance outside the restricted zone; surveillance within the restricted zone; disinfection; control of wildlife reservoirs; official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste.

[The Eurasian HPAI H5N1 virus was first detected in January 2022 on the Atlantic coast of North America and rapidly spread to many states of the USA, Canada, and Mexico, probably introduced to the Americas by one of the numerous species of birds that migrate along Nearctic and Palearctic flyways and breed in Arctic tundra regions. In November [2022] H5N1 was first detected in South America in pelicans from Peru, probably brought by infected migrants such as the blue-winged teal (_Anas discors_), which breed in North America and many winter in northern South America, including Peru. The list of South American countries where HPAI H5N1 has been detected include Colombia, Peru, Venezuela, Chile, Bolivia, Uruguay, and Argentina. Passive and active surveillance should be enhanced in poultry and wild birds of the Neotropical region.

Infections by HPAI viruses in mammals are typically not common, but since April 2022 there have been several events of Eurasian HPAI H5N1 in a wide spectrum of wild carnivores (order Carnivora). There have been reports have been in red foxes (_Vulpes vulpes_, family Canidae), bobcats (family Felidae), skunks (family Mephitidae), raccoons (family Procyonidae), bears (family Ursidae), otters and minks (family Mustelidae), seals and sea lions (suborder Pinnipedia, families Phocidae and Otariidae, respectively). There have also been cases in cetaceans. The large numbers of dead sea lions reported in Peru suggest a potential considerable impact on the sea lion populations of the South Pacific. - Mod.PMB

After a 3-year break, a case of diphtheria was registered in Latvia. The Center for Disease Prevention and Control (SPKC) confirmed to Latvian Television that it is a young man between the ages of 25 and 35. He had been vaccinated but not revaccinated.

The infected patient was treated on an outpatient basis. His contacts have been identified and their family doctors have been informed. For the time being, none of the contacts have been diagnosed with the disease. The epidemiological investigation is continuing.

In the period from 2009 to 2019, 119 cases of diphtheria were registered in Latvia, 9 of which (7.6%) were fatal. 

SPKC emphasizes that vaccination plays a crucial role in the prevention of diphtheria. Vaccination against diphtheria decreased from 2020: SPKC data of 2021 show that the vaccination coverage against diphtheria and tetanus was higher only for infants at the age of 2 months 95.9% (vaccination 1) and children at the age of 12-15 months 97.3%. However, as a person's age increases, the vaccination coverage decreases: for infants aged 6-11 months it was 94.4%; for children aged 7 years, 89.3% (in 2022 - 89.5%); for teenagers aged 14 years, 68.3% (81.8% in 2022); and 52.8% for adults (51.7% in 2022).

SPKC emphasized that insufficient vaccination coverage creates the risk of an outbreak of diphtheria and the spread of infection.

Vaccination against diphtheria is paid for by the state. You can get it from your family doctor. To confirm [your] vaccination status, check the entries in the Vaccination Passport and contact your family doctor's practice.

SPKC explained that timely vaccination and booster vaccinations protect against diphtheria. Various combination vaccines contain diphtheria toxoid, that is, diphtheria toxin that has been rendered harmless. The body of a vaccinated person has antibodies which, in case of infection, neutralize the toxin produced by the causative agent of diphtheria [_Corynebacterium diphtheriae_], and the infection does not harm the person. However, the amount of antibodies decreases with time, so regular booster vaccinations are necessary.

Children in Latvia are vaccinated against diphtheria at the ages of 2, 4, 6, and 12 to 15 months, and then at the age of 7 and 14 years. To extend lifelong immunity, adults need a booster vaccination every 10 years.

After contracting diphtheria, full-fledged immunity against diphtheria is not formed, so even people who have had diphtheria in the past should be vaccinated regularly.

SPKC emphasized: no vaccination protects 100% from getting sick. It happens that vaccinated people also fall ill with diphtheria, but in this case, the disease proceeds in a mild form with symptoms similar to a sore and red throat. Such patients recover in a few days and do not have complications caused by diphtheria toxin.

The source of diphtheria infection can be either a person with diphtheria or a healthy person who is asymptomatic but is a carrier of the diphtheria bacterium. Most often, diphtheria affects the tonsils, throat, and nasal mucosa. Diphtheria can be contracted by inhaling air containing microscopic droplets of the bacteria, which are spread by talking, coughing, or sneezing by a diphtheria sufferer or a carrier of the bacteria. In this way, you can get infected in the workplace, shop, public transport, cafe, club, cinema, etc, in public places.

The infection also has a skin form when a person gets infected through a wound, and such lesions are more difficult to recognize, SPKC said.

The incubation period of the disease is from 2 to 5 days, but in some cases, it can be even up to 10 days. Sometimes, at the beginning of the disease, a slightly increased body temperature, weakness, and sweating can be observed. These symptoms gradually progress, and the characteristic signs of diphtheria develop -- general weakness; fever; sore throat, redness, swelling, and difficulty swallowing; a dirty gray plaque appears on the tonsils, which can spread throughout the throat. The plaque is thick, skin-like, and pale gray; in small children, the plaque can start from the larynx, in this case, cough, hoarseness, and difficulty breathing occur; headache and loss of appetite are also possible.

Along with other symptoms, the diphtheria toxin is absorbed into the blood and spreads throughout the body via the bloodstream. It has a toxic effect on the heart muscle, causing muscle inflammation or myocarditis; affects the nervous system by damaging nerve fibers, and also causes kidney, liver, and adrenal tissue destruction or necrosis.

If a person shows any signs characteristic of diphtheria, he/she should be immediately hospitalized and isolated, and specific treatment should be started. If you notice signs of diphtheria, contact your family doctor immediately. Diphtheria is considered confirmed when its causative agent is isolated in the laboratory, SPKC said.

Most often people who have not been vaccinated against diphtheria can get sick; the most susceptible are unvaccinated children under the age of 10 and people who have had more than 10 years since their last vaccination.

Diphtheria can be contracted at any time of the year; people get sick even in the warm months of the year. This can be explained by the fact that in the summer people go on vacation more often and meet each other. However, diphtheria is most common in the cold months of the year -- winter, autumn, and spring.

The World Health Organization has drawn attention to the fact that the number of diphtheria cases has increased in Europe. Between the beginning of 2022 and 2 Feb 2023, 371 cases of diphtheria were reported in Germany (147), United Kingdom (73), Austria (72), Switzerland (25), Belgium (25), France (14), Norway (7), Netherlands (5), Italy (2), and Spain (1). The majority were found in male migrants aged 8 to 49 years from the countries of the Central Asian region, and the skin form of diphtheria was most often determined.

At the beginning of the year [2023], SPKC specialists addressed medical professional organizations and institutions to draw attention to the spread of diphtheria in Europe and the need to evaluate the vaccination status of doctors and patients, especially in risk groups. Healthcare workers [should] consider the possibility of diphtheria and use personal protective equipment when examining or caring for patients with respiratory symptoms of diphtheria or skin lesions such as ulcers, especially in relation to the possible spread of infection among asylum seekers, asylum seeker center workers, and other workers who come into contact with asylum seekers, while family doctors are encouraged to continue to identify unvaccinated patients and urge them to get vaccinated.

[Humans are the only reservoir of _ Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, the cause of diphtheria. Transmission of _C. diphtheriae_ can occur through respiratory droplets, direct contact with cutaneous infections, and articles soiled with discharges from the respiratory tract or skin lesions of an infected person. Travel to an endemic area is a risk factor for the acquisition of _C. diphtheriae_.

ProMED has recently posted several reports on diphtheria at facilities in Europe used to house recent refugees, asylum seekers, and migrants from endemic regions (see ProMED posts Diphtheria - France: migrants, toxigenic Corynebacterium diphtheriae/C. ulcerans 20221230.8707531; Diphtheria - Germany: toxigenic Corynebacterium diphtheriae, cutaneous, migrants 20221119.8706803; Diphtheria - UK (02): (England) asylum seekers 20221127.8706944; Diphtheria - UK: (England) asylum seekers 20221021.8706299; and Diphtheria - Switzerland: (Bern) asylum seekers 20220804.8704867). Diphtheria has also been reported in Europeans who had traveled to an endemic region where they acquired diphtheria and then returned to their place of origin.

However, the news report above says that a recent case of diphtheria in Latvia occurred in a ""man between the ages of 25 and 35"", who was ""vaccinated but not revaccinated"". No further details as to the source of his infection are given. Was he a refugee from an endemic region or a traveler who returned from an endemic region, or did he acquire the infection locally, in Latvia? More information from knowledgeable sources on this case would be appreciated . - Mod.ML

.................................................mo/ml/mj/sh","After a 3-year break, a case of diphtheria was registered in Latvia. The Center for Disease Prevention and Control (SPKC) confirmed to Latvian Television that it is a young man between the ages of 25 and 35. He had been vaccinated but not revaccinated.The infected patient was treated on an outpatient basis. His contacts have been identified and their family doctors have been informed. For the time being, none of the contacts have been diagnosed with the disease. The epidemiological investigation is continuing.In the period from 2009 to 2019, 119 cases of diphtheria were registered in Latvia, 9 of which (7.6%) were fatal. SPKC emphasizes that vaccination plays a crucial role in the prevention of diphtheria. Vaccination against diphtheria decreased from 2020: SPKC data of 2021 show that the vaccination coverage against diphtheria and tetanus was higher only for infants at the age of 2 months 95.9% (vaccination 1) and children at the age of 12-15 months 97.3%. However, as a person's age increases, the vaccination coverage decreases: for infants aged 6-11 months it was 94.4%; for children aged 7 years, 89.3% (in 2022 - 89.5%); for teenagers aged 14 years, 68.3% (81.8% in 2022); and 52.8% for adults (51.7% in 2022).SPKC emphasized that insufficient vaccination coverage creates the risk of an outbreak of diphtheria and the spread of infection.Vaccination against diphtheria is paid for by the state. You can get it from your family doctor. To confirm [your] vaccination status, check the entries in the Vaccination Passport and contact your family doctor's practice.SPKC explained that timely vaccination and booster vaccinations protect against diphtheria. Various combination vaccines contain diphtheria toxoid, that is, diphtheria toxin that has been rendered harmless. The body of a vaccinated person has antibodies which, in case of infection, neutralize the toxin produced by the causative agent of diphtheria [_Corynebacterium diphtheriae_], and the infection does not harm the person. However, the amount of antibodies decreases with time, so regular booster vaccinations are necessary.Children in Latvia are vaccinated against diphtheria at the ages of 2, 4, 6, and 12 to 15 months, and then at the age of 7 and 14 years. To extend lifelong immunity, adults need a booster vaccination every 10 years.After contracting diphtheria, full-fledged immunity against diphtheria is not formed, so even people who have had diphtheria in the past should be vaccinated regularly.SPKC emphasized: no vaccination protects 100% from getting sick. It happens that vaccinated people also fall ill with diphtheria, but in this case, the disease proceeds in a mild form with symptoms similar to a sore and red throat. Such patients recover in a few days and do not have complications caused by diphtheria toxin.The source of diphtheria infection can be either a person with diphtheria or a healthy person who is asymptomatic but is a carrier of the diphtheria bacterium. Most often, diphtheria affects the tonsils, throat, and nasal mucosa. Diphtheria can be contracted by inhaling air containing microscopic droplets of the bacteria, which are spread by talking, coughing, or sneezing by a diphtheria sufferer or a carrier of the bacteria. In this way, you can get infected in the workplace, shop, public transport, cafe, club, cinema, etc, in public places.The infection also has a skin form when a person gets infected through a wound, and such lesions are more difficult to recognize, SPKC said.The incubation period of the disease is from 2 to 5 days, but in some cases, it can be even up to 10 days. Sometimes, at the beginning of the disease, a slightly increased body temperature, weakness, and sweating can be observed. These symptoms gradually progress, and the characteristic signs of diphtheria develop -- general weakness; fever; sore throat, redness, swelling, and difficulty swallowing; a dirty gray plaque appears on the tonsils, which can spread throughout the throat.

The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is today (1 Mar [2023]) closely monitoring a human case of avian influenza A(H5N6) in mainland China, and again has urged the public to maintain strict personal, food, and environmental hygiene both locally and during travel.

The case involves a 49 year old man living in Qingyuan, Guangdong, who had contact with live domestic poultry before the onset of symptoms, which developed on 17 Dec 2022. He was admitted for treatment on 21 Dec 2022 and was in a serious condition.

From 2014 to date, 83 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported by mainland health authorities. ""All novel influenza A infections, including H5N6, are notifiable infectious diseases in Hong Kong,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Travelers to the mainland or other affected areas must avoid visiting wet markets, live poultry markets, or farms. They should be alert to the presence of backyard poultry when visiting relatives and friends. They should also avoid purchasing live or freshly slaughtered poultry and avoid touching poultry/birds or their droppings. They should strictly observe personal and hand hygiene when visiting any place with live poultry.

Travelers returning from affected areas should consult a doctor promptly if symptoms develop and inform the doctor of their travel history for prompt diagnosis and treatment of potential diseases. It is essential to tell the doctor if they have seen any live poultry during travel, which may imply possible exposure to contaminated environments. This will enable the doctor to assess the possibility of avian influenza and arrange necessary investigations and appropriate treatment in a timely manner.

While local surveillance, prevention, and control measures are in place, the CHP will remain vigilant and work closely with the World Health Organization and relevant health authorities to monitor the latest developments.

The public should maintain strict personal, hand, food, and environmental hygiene and take heed of the advice below when handling poultry:
- avoid touching poultry, birds, animals, or their droppings;
- when buying live chickens, do not touch them and their droppings. Do not blow at their bottoms. Wash eggs with detergent if soiled with faecal matter and cook and consume the eggs immediately. Always wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling chickens and eggs;
- eggs should be cooked well until the white and yolk become firm. Do not eat raw eggs or dip cooked food into any sauce with raw eggs. Poultry should be cooked thoroughly. If there is pinkish juice running from the cooked poultry or the middle part of its bone is still red, the poultry should be cooked again until fully done;
- wash hands frequently, especially before touching the mouth, nose, or eyes; before handling food or eating; and after going to the toilet, touching public installations or equipment such as escalator handrails, elevator control panels, or doorknobs; or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing; and
- wear a mask if fever or respiratory symptoms develop, when going to a hospital or clinic, or while taking care of patients with fever or respiratory symptoms.

The public may visit the CHP's pages for more information: the avian influenza page, the weekly Avian Influenza Report, global statistics and affected areas of avian influenza, the Facebook Page, and the YouTube Channel.

The Magetan Regency [East Java] Livestock and Fisheries Service recorded 214 cows owned by residents suspected of having lumpy skin disease (LSD). Head of the Livestock and Fisheries Service for Magetan Regency, Nur Hayani, said that 10 cows belonging to the UPTD [Unit Pelaksana Teknis Daerah; regional technical implementation unit] of the East Java Provincial Government in Pramplelan Village, Karangrejo District, tested positive for LSD.

Related to these findings, the Magetan Regency Animal Husbandry and Fisheries Service will intensify vaccinations, especially for dairy cows. The Magetan Regency Animal Husbandry and Fisheries Service has received 1380 doses of the LSD vaccine. The agency will prioritize administering vaccines to residents' dairy cows.

""Currently, our vaccine is still 700 doses. We do prioritize the 1st for dairy cows. Our dairy cow population currently reaches 1053 heads,"" he added.

[The first recording of lumpy skin disease (LSD) in Indonesia was related to central Sumatra, in March 2022. In September 2022, LSD was confirmed near Semarang in Central Java. On 8 Dec 2022, Australian sources reported [ProMED post 20221210.8707179] its spread to East Java [Jawa Timur], including near the city of Malang, capital of Java's main dairy district. Its current detection in the inland Magetan Regency, in the west of the province, adjoining Central Java, attests to its continued circulation in several parts of East Java [map at <https://tinyurl.com/mptj73uf>].

Scientists from Haryana Agricultural University have found that the dwarfing disease in paddy crops in the country is not only caused by _Southern rice black streaked dwarf virus_ (SRBSDV), but also by _Rice gall dwarf virus_ (RGDV). Information has also been obtained on the host range of these viruses.

SRBSDV infection has been found to be more prevalent in the disease, and this virus also affects some weeds in local wheat crops, which is a concern. There has been no instance of the virus infecting wheat in the area. Therefore, farmers should destroy weeds in wheat fields to reduce the risk of dwarfing disease in paddy crops.

The scientists continually record the distribution and spread of the viruses. They recommend regular sanitary measures for fields and irrigation drains to prevent further spread of the disease.

[Symptoms of black streaked dwarf disease (BSDD) of rice include darkening and distortion of leaves, black streaked tumours along leaf veins, as well as severe stunting of plants. BSDD due to _Rice black streaked dwarf virus_ (RBSDV; genus _Fijivirus_) has been known to cause serious crop losses in South East Asia. RBSDV also affects some other gramineous hosts including maize, wheat, oat, and barley. It is spread by planthoppers including _Laodelphax striatellus_ and _Unkanodes_ species.

_Southern rice black streaked dwarf virus_ (SRBSDV; genus _Fijivirus_) has been identified more recently and is now considered an emerging BSDD pathogen in Asia. It is transmitted by the white-backed planthopper (WBPH; _Sogatella furcifera_), which is not a vector of RBSDV, while the RBSDV vector _L. striatellus_ cannot spread SRBSDV. SRBSDV can also affect maize, sorghum, and several grasses as additional crop or reservoir hosts.

_Rice gall dwarf virus_ (RGDV; genus _Phytoreovirus_) is spread by the leafhopper _Recilia dorsalis_. It is known to occur in coinfections, for example with _Rice stripe mosaic virus_ (genus _Cytorhabdovirus_), which shares the same vector. RGDV also affects a range of cereal crops and grasses, causing severe stunting, leaf galls, and severe reduction of grain yield.

Disease management for rice viruses may include cultural practices, vector control, and use of cultivars with resistance to the virus, the vector, or both. High vector numbers are often associated with outbreaks of the viruses they transmit. This is a major concern in the region where rice crops are frequently affected by viruses and their insect vectors (see previous ProMED posts in the archives).

Given the possible severity of anthrax infection, early and fast diagnosis is key. InBios International, Inc., a leading developer of diagnostic tests for emerging infectious diseases and biothreats, has been granted the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) 1st marketing rights for an anthrax point-of-care (POC) test. This approval was granted through the FDA's De Novo process for new medical devices or technology where there is no comparable device on the market.

InBios' Active Anthrax Detect Plus Rapid Test for pulmonary anthrax is for use as an aid in the diagnosis of inhalation anthrax, which occurs by breathing in anthrax spores and is the deadliest form of the disease. This test produces results in about 20 minutes and is intended for use by military personnel, medical and/or healthcare professionals only.

This in vitro immunochromatographic assay provides visual and rapid qualitative detection of the _Bacillus anthracis_ lethal factor protein and can be used to test serum and venous whole blood (dipotassium EDTA, sodium citrate and sodium heparin) from individuals who have signs and symptoms consistent with inhalation anthrax and a likelihood of exposure. While a positive Active Anthrax Detect Plus Rapid Test result is presumptively diagnostic for _B. anthracis_ infection, diagnosis of infection must be based on history, signs, symptoms, exposure likelihood, and additional laboratory evidence.

Clinical performance determined that the test had a negative percent agreement (NPA) of 100% and a positive percent agreement (PPA) of >98%. The specificity study (NPA) was conducted at 3 POC clinical sites in the United States, while the sensitivity (PPA) of the test was evaluated using contrived positive serum samples.

""With ease of dispersal and a high mortality rate, inhalation anthrax is a great threat to the security and safety of the world,"" said Syamal Raychaudhuri, PhD, InBios Chief Scientific Officer. ""A fast, accurate test is needed to prepare for a potential bioterrorism attack or outbreak. Our test could play a critical role in thwarting any suspicious activities early on.""

The De Novo classification for the Active Anthrax Detect Plus Rapid Test was supported in whole or in part with federal funds from the Department of Health and Human Services; Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response; Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), under contract number HHSO100201700029C awarded in 2017. Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provided significant expertise and resources, which contributed toward the development of the Active Anthrax Detect Plus Rapid Test.

Anthrax is a zoonotic bacterial disease caused by _Bacillus anthracis_, a gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium commonly found in the soil of disease-endemic areas. The disease presents with non-specific symptoms that cannot easily be distinguished from many common diseases. Although anthrax infection is rare, risk of infection remains, whether due to bioterrorism or injectional drug usage. For more information, visit <http://www.cdc.gov/anthrax>.

[This test claims a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity >98%, which are fair numbers to start with. Time will tell whether it will live up to its promise. Human cutaneous cases are infrequent in the United States and Canada, and usually follow from the careless skinning of a dead deer or cow. If the test is cheap, there would be a market for it for livestock and wildlife veterinarians who see cases in the Dakotas, Texas, and other states. Latterly, they have been using a free test out of Fort Detrick based on protective antigen in the blood of dead animals. Humans and white-tail deer do not have PA titres high enough to trigger this test, which has been around for decades. This test may be fine but don't get me wrong: If we really need to be using it, we will be in deep trouble. - Mod.MHJ

This approval was granted through the FDA's De Novo process for new medical devices or technology where there is no comparable device on the market.InBios' Active Anthrax Detect Plus Rapid Test for pulmonary anthrax is for use as an aid in the diagnosis of inhalation anthrax, which occurs by breathing in anthrax spores and is the deadliest form of the disease. This test produces results in about 20 minutes and is intended for use by military personnel, medical and/or healthcare professionals only.This in vitro immunochromatographic assay provides visual and rapid qualitative detection of the _Bacillus anthracis_ lethal factor protein and can be used to test serum and venous whole blood (dipotassium EDTA, sodium citrate and sodium heparin) from individuals who have signs and symptoms consistent with inhalation anthrax and a likelihood of exposure. While a positive Active Anthrax Detect Plus Rapid Test result is presumptively diagnostic for _B. anthracis_ infection, diagnosis of infection must be based on history, signs, symptoms, exposure likelihood, and additional laboratory evidence.Clinical performance determined that the test had a negative percent agreement (NPA) of 100% and a positive percent agreement (PPA) of >98%. The specificity study (NPA) was conducted at 3 POC clinical sites in the United States, while the sensitivity (PPA) of the test was evaluated using contrived positive serum samples.""With ease of dispersal and a high mortality rate, inhalation anthrax is a great threat to the security and safety of the world,"" said Syamal Raychaudhuri, PhD, InBios Chief Scientific Officer. ""A fast, accurate test is needed to prepare for a potential bioterrorism attack or outbreak. Our test could play a critical role in thwarting any suspicious activities early on.""The De Novo classification for the Active Anthrax Detect Plus Rapid Test was supported in whole or in part with federal funds from the Department of Health and Human Services; Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response; Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), under contract number HHSO100201700029C awarded in 2017. Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provided significant expertise and resources, which contributed toward the development of the Active Anthrax Detect Plus Rapid Test.Anthrax is a zoonotic bacterial disease caused by _Bacillus anthracis_, a gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium commonly found in the soil of disease-endemic areas. The disease presents with non-specific symptoms that cannot easily be distinguished from many common diseases. Although anthrax infection is rare, risk of infection remains, whether due to bioterrorism or injectional drug usage. For more information, visit <http://www.cdc.gov/anthrax>.--communicated by:ProMED[This test claims a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity >98%, which are fair numbers to start with. Time will tell whether it will live up to its promise. Human cutaneous cases are infrequent in the United States and Canada, and usually follow from the careless skinning of a dead deer or cow. If the test is cheap, there would be a market for it for livestock and wildlife veterinarians who see cases in the Dakotas, Texas, and other states. Latterly, they have been using a free test out of Fort Detrick based on protective antigen in the blood of dead animals. Humans and white-tail deer do not have PA titres high enough to trigger this test, which has been around for decades. This test may be fine but don't get me wrong: If we really need to be using it, we will be in deep trouble. - Mod.MHJProMED map:United States: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8708665,106>]",CISION Prweb,,

Clinic's patients, factory's workers tracked amid 1st local measles case since 2014
-------------------------------------------------------------
Public health officials are alerting citizens, and following up with at least 100 close contacts in Woodstock and London, after identifying a lab-confirmed case of the measles - the 1st in London and surrounding Middlesex County in nearly a decade.

The unidentified individual who tested positive for measles lives in London but works in Woodstock, the Middlesex-London Health Unit and Southwestern Public Health said in a joint statement Saturday afternoon [18 Feb 2023].

Officials believe the person contracted the highly contagious virus during a trip to India, a part of the world where the vaccine-preventable disease still spreads, Middlesex-London's top public health official, Dr. Alex Summers, said Saturday [18 Feb 2023].

""We are really relying, obviously, on our case and contact management team, but also on the underlying vaccination coverage that we have in our community,"" he said. ""We hope that we don't see additional cases, but we have to prepare for that, which is why we're following up with all these individuals.""

The health units were notified about the case on Friday afternoon [17 Feb 2023]. The individual had limited contact with others when they were infectious, public health officials say.

The person went to a London medical clinic on 15 Feb 2023 between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m. and worked overnight shifts at Nova Steel in Woodstock on 9 Feb and 12 Feb 2023 from 10 p.m. to 8 a.m.

Middlesex-London Health Unit contact tracers are following up with approximately 100 people who were potentially exposed at the medical clinic, Summers said.

There are 2 more people in Equatorial Guinea who have died of Marburg haemorrhagic fever, a cousin of the Ebola virus, bringing the toll of fatalities to 11, the authorities say. ""The monitoring system recorded 8 notifications 2 days ago, including the deaths of 2 people with symptoms of the disease,"" health minister Mitoha Ondo'o Ayekaba said in a statement issued late on Tuesday [28 Feb 2023].

Work is under way ""to strengthen assessment of the spread of the epidemic,"" said the statement, read on national television. ""There are 48 contact cases that have been documented, 4 of whom have developed symptoms, and 3 who have been quarantined in hospital,"" it added.

The Marburg virus is a rare but highly dangerous pathogen that causes severe fever, often accompanied by bleeding and organ failure. It is part of the so-called filovirus family that also includes the Ebola virus, which has wreaked havoc in several previous outbreaks in Africa.

The central African state announced on 13 Feb [2023] that 9 people had died from Marburg between 7 Jan and 7 Feb [2023]. The UN's World Health Organization (WHO) held an emergency session the following day [14 Feb 2023]. The national authorities have declared a health alert in the remote north eastern province of Kie-Ntem province and in the neighbouring district of Mongomo, which are located on the border with Cameroon and Gabon. Measures include a lockdown plan implemented in collaboration with WHO.

In their statement of 13 Feb [2023], the authorities had reported only 3 cases of infection in addition to the fatalities -- individuals who were being isolated with ""mild symptoms"" in hospital.

The natural host of the Marburg virus is the African fruit bat, which carries the virus but does not fall sick from it. But the animals can pass the virus to primates in close proximity, including humans, and human-to-human transmission then occurs through contact with blood or other bodily fluids. Fatality rates in confirmed cases have ranged from 24% to 88% in previous outbreaks, depending on the virus strain and case management, according to WHO.

There are currently no approved vaccines or antiviral treatments. Potential treatments, including blood products, immune therapies, and drug therapies, as well as early candidate vaccines are being evaluated, says WHO.

<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/feb/28/japanese-encephalitis-may-have-infected-one-in-30-people-in-parts-of-northern-victoria>


Japanese encephalitis has infected as many as one in 30 people in parts of northern Victoria, the state's health department has said as it opened vaccine eligibility to more local government areas. The department estimated the number in affected northern Victorian council areas, which was higher than previously thought, after a serosurvey indicated a greater number of cases than the 13 reported during last year's [2022] mosquito season.

The survey took responses and blood samples from 800 participants in Loddon Mallee, Goulburn Valley, and Ovens Murray. The majority of those who showed evidence of prior infection were male and were identified in all 3 regions surveyed. ""By finding more cases than we were previously aware of, this important research reinforces the risk to all in the community that mosquitoborne diseases pose, especially in light of recent flood activity,"" Victoria's deputy chief health officer, Deborah Friedman, said in a statement. The health department has expanded free Japanese encephalitis virus [JEV] vaccine eligibility to include Greater Bendigo, Northern Grampians, Hindmarsh, Horsham, Buloke, Yarriambiack, and West Wimmera council areas.

Mosquitoborne diseases have been on the rise in flood-affected areas in south eastern Australia, with cases of JEV detected in New South Wales [NSW], Victoria, and South Australia. In February [2023], Victoria recorded its 1st Murray Valley encephalitis [MVE] death since 1974, and NSW confirmed its 1st MVE case since 2011. There is currently no preventive vaccine for MVE.

Most people with either virus do not develop symptoms, but both can cause a clinical illness in a small number of infected people.

[As the above report notes, most human Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infections are asymptomatic or very mild. Since a recent 2nd human JE case has occurred in Victoria state during this transmission season (see Japanese encephalitis - Australia (01): (VI) 20230204.8708161), one would expect that many more individuals had been infected as well, as the above report indicates. The 1st case occurred in a resident of a flood-affected region of the state in late December 2022 (see Japanese encephalitis - Australia (32): (VI) 20221230.8707539). The occurrence of JEV infections in Victoria state is not surprising: JE virus has been detected in mosquitoes in several states in the Murray River watershed in recent weeks, and health authorities have been warning the public of the risk of infection. Recent flooding has provided ample breeding sites for vector mosquitoes. Over the current transmission season,  ProMED has not received reports of JE virus infection in pig farms. Infections in piggeries were common previously, often before human cases occurred, and can be expected again in the near future. Surveillance of mosquitoes in the areas where JE virus transmission has occurred in the past continues, as is monitoring of human cases and, presumably, pigs as well. - Mod.TY

The department estimated the number in affected northern Victorian council areas, which was higher than previously thought, after a serosurvey indicated a greater number of cases than the 13 reported during last year's [2022] mosquito season.The survey took responses and blood samples from 800 participants in Loddon Mallee, Goulburn Valley, and Ovens Murray. The majority of those who showed evidence of prior infection were male and were identified in all 3 regions surveyed. ""By finding more cases than we were previously aware of, this important research reinforces the risk to all in the community that mosquitoborne diseases pose, especially in light of recent flood activity,"" Victoria's deputy chief health officer, Deborah Friedman, said in a statement. The health department has expanded free Japanese encephalitis virus [JEV] vaccine eligibility to include Greater Bendigo, Northern Grampians, Hindmarsh, Horsham, Buloke, Yarriambiack, and West Wimmera council areas.Mosquitoborne diseases have been on the rise in flood-affected areas in south eastern Australia, with cases of JEV detected in New South Wales [NSW], Victoria, and South Australia. In February [2023], Victoria recorded its 1st Murray Valley encephalitis [MVE] death since 1974, and NSW confirmed its 1st MVE case since 2011. There is currently no preventive vaccine for MVE.Most people with either virus do not develop symptoms, but both can cause a clinical illness in a small number of infected people.--communicated by:ProMED from HealthMap Alerts[As the above report notes, most human Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infections are asymptomatic or very mild. Since a recent 2nd human JE case has occurred in Victoria state during this transmission season (see Japanese encephalitis - Australia (01): (VI) 20230204.8708161), one would expect that many more individuals had been infected as well, as the above report indicates. The 1st case occurred in a resident of a flood-affected region of the state in late December 2022 (see Japanese encephalitis - Australia (32): (VI) 20221230.8707539). The occurrence of JEV infections in Victoria state is not surprising: JE virus has been detected in mosquitoes in several states in the Murray River watershed in recent weeks, and health authorities have been warning the public of the risk of infection. Recent flooding has provided ample breeding sites for vector mosquitoes. Over the current transmission season,  ProMED has not received reports of JE virus infection in pig farms. Infections in piggeries were common previously, often before human cases occurred, and can be expected again in the near future. Surveillance of mosquitoes in the areas where JE virus transmission has occurred in the past continues, as is monitoring of human cases and, presumably, pigs as well. - Mod.TYProMED map of Victoria, Australia: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8708653,288>.]",The Guardian,,

Persistent strain of _E. coli_ O157:H7 (REPEXH01) linked to multiple sources
--------------------------------------------------------------------
REPEXH01
---------
REPEXH01 is a persistent strain of Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 bacteria [also called enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_, EHEC] that has caused illnesses and outbreaks in the USA.

CDC uses ""persistent"" to describe some strains of bacteria that have caused illness for years. The strains continue to cause illness, even though the number of illnesses they cause might vary over time. The strains are sometimes linked to more than a single source, making them harder to control.

Illness caused by this strain was first reported to PulseNet in 2017. Illnesses caused by this strain occur year-round but are less common in winter. In the past, the REPEXH01 strain has spread to people through contaminated food and contaminated recreational water.

This strain is relatively diverse genetically. Bacteria in this strain are within 21 allele differences of one another by whole-genome sequencing [WGS], which is more diverse than typical multistate foodborne outbreaks where bacteria generally fall within 10 allele differences of one another. [There is a REPEXH02 EHEC strain that is less genetically diverse. - Mod.LL]

Outbreaks and outbreak-related illnesses
----------------------------------------
Although most enteric illnesses -- including those caused by REPEXH01 -- are not part of an outbreak, investigation of outbreaks provides information that increases our understanding of germs, sources, settings, and factors that contribute to illness. Moreover, lab-confirmed cases comprise only a small portion of the true number of illnesses that occur because most people do not seek medical care and even fewer submit a stool specimen.

Starting in 2017, CDC and local, state, and federal health and regulatory partners have investigated several outbreaks of _E. coli_ O157:H7 illnesses caused by the REPEXH01 strain.

Laboratory data
--------------
WGS analysis:
Bacteria in this strain are within 21 allele differences of one another by core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST), which is more diverse than typical multistate foodborne outbreaks where bacteria generally fall within 10 allele differences of one another. This strain includes 2 major genetic subclusters. Each has caused at least 2 outbreaks linked to different sources and geographic regions. Possible reasons for the differences among genetic subclusters are still being investigated. More research is needed to determine if any genetic subclusters are associated with specific foods, animal populations, or geographic regions.

Isolates from food, animal, and environmental samples:

Year / Number of isolates / Isolate type / Geographic location of source / Reason collected
2017 / 1 / goose feces / California / outbreak A
2017 / 2 / lake sediment / California / outbreak A
2017 / 4 / lake water / California / outbreak A
2018 / 24 / agricultural irrigation water / Arizona / outbreak B
2019 / 1 / ground beef / California / routine sampling

Genomic information:
The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) advances science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information.

SNP Cluster: PDS000059979.158

Antimicrobial resistance information:

The National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) is a national public health surveillance system that tracks antimicrobial resistance for certain intestinal bacteria from sick people (CDC), retail meats (FDA), and food animals (USDA) in the USA. The NARMS program helps protect public health by providing information about emerging antimicrobial resistance, the ways in which resistance is spread, and how resistant infections differ from susceptible infections.

Bacteria from most sick people's samples showed resistance to the antimicrobials chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. These findings do not affect treatment guidance because antimicrobials are not recommended for patients with _E. coli_ O157:H7 infection.

""Reoccurring, emerging, and persisting enteric bacterial strains
--------------------------------------------------------
Some enteric bacterial strains cause acute outbreaks linked to specific sources. Other strains, referred to as reoccurring, emerging, or persisting (REP) strains, can reoccur and periodically cause acute outbreaks. They can also emerge and increase in frequency or persist and cause illnesses over periods of months or years, despite investigation and prevention efforts. Investigators use a laboratory method called whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to identify the DNA fingerprints of bacteria from ill people and from foods, animals, and the environment. These DNA fingerprints represent strains of bacteria.

Investigators use these DNA fingerprints to find outbreaks of enteric (gastrointestinal) diseases. When scientists identify a group of people who got sick around the same time with a strain with the same DNA fingerprint, this represents a possible outbreak. Investigators then work to determine what caused the illnesses. These acute outbreaks tend to start off with a significant rise in illnesses followed by a significant decline over a short period of time.

WGS has also enabled investigators to find and investigate groups of illnesses that are caused by the same strain but that occur over time periods longer than an acute outbreak. These strains can reoccur and periodically cause acute outbreaks, emerge and increasingly cause illness, or persist and cause illnesses over periods of months or years. They may continue to cause illnesses despite investigation and prevention efforts.

Identifying a strain as an REP strain is based on many factors, including the number of illnesses, whether illnesses are increasing, the characteristics of the strain (for example, multidrug resistance, high virulence, increased transmissibility), and whether the strain is the cause of large or frequent outbreaks.

""REP strain characteristics
-------------------------
Reoccurring strains: Strains repeatedly causing acute outbreaks separated by periods during which the strain either does not make people sick or causes illnesses at very low levels.

Emerging strains: Previously novel or rare strains that increasingly cause illnesses or show the potential to cause increasing illness.

Persisting strains: Strains causing illnesses consistently over a long time.

""CDC's role
----------
Since 2019, CDC has used the PulseNet system to identify and monitor REP strains of several major pathogens, including salmonella, _E. coli_ O157:H7, listeria, and campylobacter. PulseNet uses a combination of different WGS tools for identifying and tracking these strains and will develop more as new strains are identified and investigated.

CDC uses information gained from investigations of REP strains to better understand their sources, track how they change over time, and collaborate on measures to reduce their spread.""

Kawasho Foods USA is recalling one of its Geisha canned shrimp products over concerns of potential contamination with _Clostridium botulinum_, a potentially lethal toxin. The voluntary recall, covering the company's Geisha Medium Shrimp 4-Ounce canned product, was initiated after some of the cans were found to be swelling, leaking, or bursting. According to a 27 Feb [2023] announcement from the Food and Drug Administration, there is a possibility the product was underprocessed, leading to spoilage and the development of harmful organisms or pathogens.

The New York City, USA-based company announced the cans were distributed to retail locations of major retailers including Walmart, Albertsons, Safeway, Associated Food Stores, and Stater Bros Markets in the US states of California, Utah, Arizona, and Colorado.

Botulism is a rare but serious illness caused by a toxin that attacks the body's nerves and causes difficulty breathing, muscle paralysis, and even death, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The company has recalled products with UPC label #071140003909 from lot LGC12W12E22 with a best-by date of 12 May 2026. ""Consumers should not use this product, even if it does not look or smell spoiled,"" the company warned. Consumers are eligible for a full refund if they return the recalled products to their place of purchase.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures that could, but do not necessarily, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_.

Foodborne botulism usually occurs when preformed toxin is absorbed through the intestinal tract, and when the botulinum toxin is exposed to the neuromuscular junction, the heavy chain of the botulinum neurotoxin binds to glycoprotein structures specifically found on cholinergic nerve terminals. This specific docking is the reason for BT's (botulinum toxin's) high selectivity for cholinergic synapses. After internalization, the light chain of the botulinum neurotoxin binds with high specificity to the SNARE protein complex. The target proteins vary among the BT serotypes. BT-A cleaves synaptosomal-associated proteins of 25kDa (SNAP-25). BT-B cleaves vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP), also known as synaptobrevin II. - Mod.LL

Date: Tue 28 Feb 2023
Source: Brandenburg official State portal, press release 074/2023 [in German, trans. by communicator, edited] 
<https://msgiv.brandenburg.de/msgiv/de/presse/pressemitteilungen/detail/~28-02-2023-asp-hausbestand-cb>


African swine fever (ASF) was confirmed in a herd of domestic pigs in the Spree-Neisse district. The affected smallholding includes 11 animals. The farm was immediately restricted by the official veterinarian and the necessary measures were implemented. The virus was first detected by the Berlin-Brandenburg state laboratory. Today [28 Feb 2023], the national reference laboratory, the Friedrich Loeffler Institute (FLI), confirmed the suspicion of ASF.

Investigations into the means of the entry of the pathogen into the pig population have begun. The veterinary office is supported by the country's animal disease control service. The crisis center of the state of Brandenburg is in constant contact with the veterinary office of the district. The holding is located in core area 6, which is in the south of the district, in the immediate vicinity of the Saxon border. The pigs in the herd were killed today and disposed of.

In [July 2021], ASF was detected in domestic pig populations for the first time in the state of Brandenburg. There were 3 farms (including 2 very small holdings) in the rural districts of Spree-Neisse and Märkisch-Oderland. In [July 2022] there was another ASF outbreak in a pig farm in the Uckermark district.

Secretary of state for consumer protection Dr Antje Töpfer once again appeals to all pig farms and in particular to all small farms to strictly comply with the prescribed biosecurity measures in order to prevent further outbreaks in domestic pigs. African swine fever has already been found in a total of 3007 wild boar in Brandenburg.

African swine fever is a contagious disease of pigs (domestic and wild pigs), which is almost always fatal and incurable. There is no way to protect pigs with preventive vaccination. The disease can be transmitted directly from animal to animal or indirectly by humans to other areas via contaminated objects (clothing, shoes, vehicles) and food. ASF is not contagious or dangerous to humans or other animal species.

Another case of African swine fever (ASF) has been confirmed in farm pigs in east Germany, authorities said on [Tue 28 Feb 2023]. It was reported on a small farm with 11 animals in the eastern state of Brandenburg, the state's health ministry said. All 11 animals were slaughtered as a precaution, it said.

China and a series of other pork buyers banned imports of German pig meat in [September 2020] after the first case was confirmed in wild animals. Discoveries on farms will make it harder for Germany to get the export bans lifted, analysts say.

The disease is not dangerous to humans but is fatal for pigs. Many countries impose bans on pork from regions suffering from the disease, distorting the world food trade.

Wild boar coming into Germany from Poland were believed to have spread the disease to Germany, especially in the eastern states of Brandenburg and Saxony.

[In the absence of a licensed vaccine against ASF, the only way to prevent its introduction to ASF-free countries or to control (ideally, eradicate) it from affected regions are severe biosecurity measures, including culling the pig population of infected and contact holdings and wild boars.
 
Recently, a Philippines-based agriculture product firm announced that ASF vaccines ""could soon be available in the country once the clinical trials for a Vietnam-made vaccine are completed and proven successful"". Reportedly, ""safety and efficacy trials using the AVAC ASF Live vaccine are being conducted, under the supervision of the Bureau of Animal Industry, in 4 local farms. These trials are expected to be completed in April [2023]"". See <https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2023/02/20/2246222/vaccines-asf-may-be-available-soon>.

The Vietnamese government recently reported that more than 600 000 doses of the AVAC ASF vaccine have been administered in field trials since July [2022]: ""Because of the highly favorable results, the Vietnamese government will also start this month its own nationwide distribution of the vaccine to help local hog farmers.""

The field trials in Vietnam and the Philippines are expected to be followed with interest elsewhere. - Mod.AS]

[1] Selected countries
[A] China: classes halted amid school COVID cluster, flu returns
Date: Thu 23 Feb 2023 3:52 AM GMT+1
Source: Bloomberg News [edited]
<https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-23/china-halts-some-classes-amid-school-covid-cluster-flu-s-return>


A number of schools across China halted classes earlier this week to stem the spread of COVID and other pathogens ranging from flu to norovirus, as the country begins to see a comeback of other illnesses after pandemic restrictions were eased.

Ten 2nd-graders in the same classroom tested positive for COVID on rapid antigen tests last weekend [17-18 Feb 2023] in eastern e-commerce hub Hangzhou, prompting local education authorities to suspend their class for 4 days starting Monday [20 Feb 2023]. The students were likely infected for the 1st time, officials said.

Shanghai suspended in-person teaching in an elementary school class after 4 students were diagnosed with the flu and others developed similar symptoms. Flu cases -- and subsequent class suspensions -- were also reported in other schools across Zhejiang province, the Chinese capital Beijing, and the nearby city of Tianjin.

The fresh surges parallel what was seen globally after countries eased COVID social distancing rules which kept other illnesses largely at bay. The ""twindemic"", as the tandem waves of COVID and influenza have been termed, stands to get worse in China which saw years of some of the world's strictest measures, followed by one of its fastest pivots back to normal life.

China's unexpected rush to dismantle nearly all pandemic restrictions in early December [2022] unleashed the world's biggest COVID outbreak, with nearly 90% of the country's 1.4 billion population infected in less than 2 months. While the reopening wave appears to have ebbed, the national CDC still reports around 10 000 COVID cases each day that were confirmed by laboratory tests.

While lockdowns and mass testing have eased as China moves on from its COVID Zero policy, authorities still grant schools the ability to halt in-person teaching -- either by individual grade level, or the entire campus -- to prevent wider outbreaks caused by COVID and other infectious diseases.

[B] Canada: surge in hospitalizations of babies and children due to COVID recorded in 2nd year of pandemic
Date: Thu 23 Feb 2023 3:04 PM CET
Source: CTV News [edited]
<https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/massive-surge-in-hospitalizations-of-babies-and-young-kids-due-to-covid-recorded-in-2nd-year-of-pandemic-1.6285415>


In the 2nd year of the pandemic, hospitalizations due to COVID-19 skyrocketed more than 600 per cent among children aged 0-4 compared with the previous year, according to new data from the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI).

In 2020-2021, there were 325 hospitalizations of children in this cohort due to COVID-19, but in 2021-2022, there were 2315 hospitalizations of children aged 0-4 in Canada due to COVID-19, CIHI reports [seven times higher]. The data, released on Thursday [23 Feb 2023], shows COVID-19 was the 6th highest reason children of this age group were hospitalized.

Respiratory infections not related to COVID-19 also resurged as a cause of hospitalization for children aged 0-4 in 2021-2022. The previous year, non-COVID respiratory infections didn't make the top 10 list of hospitalization causes for this age group at all. In 2021-2022, ""other acute lower respiratory infections"" were listed as the 2nd highest reason for hospitalizations -- pneumonia was number 5 and ""acute upper respiratory infections"" was number 7 on the list.

It's concerning to see hospitalizations among young children increasing so significantly, experts say. ""This uptick in hospitalizations for COVID-19, respiratory infections, and other viral illnesses seen among the youngest Canadians in the 2nd year of the pandemic is concerning both for the health of our youngest and most vulnerable, and for the additional strain placed on health systems and health care workers that were already stretched thin,"" Juliana Wu, director of acute and ambulatory care information services at CIHI, said in a press release. ""We are continuing to monitor hospital activity in this 3rd year of the pandemic to understand the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 on Canadians.""

The data also shows in 2021-2022, COVID-19 hospitalized far more Canadians across all age groups than in 2020-2021.

In 2020-2021, COVID-19 was the 7th commonest cause of hospitalizations for all Canadians, according to CIHI. However, in 2021-2022, the only thing more likely to put you in the hospital than COVID-19 was giving birth.

COVID-19 was 2nd on the top 10 list of reasons Canadians were hospitalized in 2021-2022, ahead of heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, substance use disorders, other medical care such as palliative care, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchitis, neurocognitive disorders, mood (affective) disorders, and osteoarthritis of the knee, in that order.

The total number of inpatient hospitalizations in Canada due to COVID-19 in 2020-2021, according to CIHI, was 47 715. In 2021-2022, there were 77 344 inpatient hospitalizations due to the virus.

The CIHI report noted that for the purposes of this data, COVID-19 hospitalizations were identified as hospitalizations where COVID-19 was responsible for the bulk of the hospital stay. This number may differ from other data sets which include hospitalization data with all COVID-19 diagnoses, regardless of if they are primary or secondary.

[C] EU: excess mortality rose sharply to 19% in December 2022
Date: Thu 17 Feb 2023
Source: Eurostat [abridged, edited]
<https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/w/DDN-20230217-1>


Excess mortality in the EU in December 2022 soared to +19% of the average number of deaths for the same period in 2016-2019, the highest recorded value in 2022. This is a sharp increase from November, when excess mortality was at +8%. In comparison, the excess mortality rate was +30% in December 2020 and +24% in December 2021.

This information comes from data on excess mortality published by Eurostat today [17  Feb  2023], based on a weekly death data collection. The article presents a handful of findings from the more detailed Statistics Explained articles on excess mortality and weekly deaths.

In December 2022, excess mortality continued to vary across the EU members. Romania and Bulgaria (both -6%) recorded values lower than the national monthly average for 2016-19, while Hungary (+3%), Luxembourg, Spain, and Malta (all +10%) had excess mortality rates less than half the EU average.

Conversely, the highest rate was recorded in Germany (+37%). Other countries with rates over +20% were Austria (+27%), Slovenia (+26 %), Ireland and France (both +25%), Czechia, the Netherlands, and Estonia (all +23 %), Denmark (+22%), and Finland and Lithuania (both +21%).

The EU registered earlier major peaks in excess deaths in April 2020 (+25%), November 2020 (+40%), April 2021 (+21%), and November 2021 (+27%). July 2022 also showed significantly higher than the baseline mortality, possibly due to the heatwaves that affected parts of Europe during the reference period.

The vast majority of new COVID-19 infections are caused by one omicron subvariant that appears to be on its way to complete domination over the US.

The highly transmissible omicron subvariant XBB.1.5 caused 85% of coronavirus cases this week, according to estimates from CDC. It's the only major strain that is increasing, setting it up to potentially drive virtually all infections in the coming weeks. XBB.1.5 is up from 79% of infections last week and 72% the week before. It has been a rapid rise for the subvariant, which made up just 4% of cases 3 months ago.

While the new booster shots were designed to take on omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5, updated government data shows that they are holding up against XBB.1.5. CDC officials on Friday [24 Feb  2023] presented updated data on the booster to a meeting of the agency's vaccine experts, finding that the shots have a higher efficacy among children than adults.

They said that the updated booster is about 65% effective against symptomatic infection in kids 5-11 years old up to a month after they get the shot. It's slightly more effective among adolescents 12-17 years old at 68%. The numbers decrease in the following months as efficacy wanes. For adults 18-49, the efficacy against symptomatic infection up to a month after administration is 51%. For people 50-64, the number decreases to 46%. Americans 65 and older mount the lowest protection at 38%, which declines to just 21% up to five months after the shot.

Uptake of the booster has been dismal, attracting just 16% of Americans. Federal health officials are eyeing a switch to an annual COVID-19 booster shot beginning in the fall, but some Americans are hoping to get their next shot sooner than that, citing concerns that the efficacy of the shots starts to wane after a few short months.

[3] Challenges in updating future COVID-19 vaccine compositions

[ref: Grant R, Sacks JA, Abraham P, et al. When to update COVID-19 vaccine composition. Nat Med. 2023
----------------------------------------------------------------
Vaccines against different SARS-CoV-2 variants have been approved, but continued surveillance is needed to determine when the antigen composition of vaccines should be updated, together with clinical studies to assess vaccine efficacy.

In September 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) established the Technical Advisory Group on COVID-19 Vaccine Composition (TAG-CO-VAC) to assess the public health implications of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) on the performance of COVID-19 vaccines and to issue timely recommendations on proposed modifications to vaccine antigen composition. The TAG-CO-VAC has evaluated evidence to inform its advice on COVID-19 vaccine composition so far, but there remain challenges and evidence gaps that the scientific community needs to address to enable future, timely decisions on modifications to COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition.

The current decision-making process of the advisory group is triggered by the designation of VOCs by WHO, upon the advice of the Technical Advisory Group on SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution (TAG-VE), and consists of 2 steps. The 1st step is to decide whether an update to vaccine composition should be considered, based on the nature and location of changes in the spike protein and associated antigenic effect, transmissibility or spread, and clinical severity of the VOC; and the effectiveness of current vaccines. The 2nd step is an assessment of whether an updated vaccine composition is warranted to maintain protection against severe disease and death and elicit a greater breadth in immunological cross-reactivity against circulating and emerging VOCs. The key data considered are cross-neutralization of VOCs in the context of the emerging variant after infection or vaccination with current and alternative antigens in people with varied previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2 antigens.

Although index virus-based vaccines are still highly effective in preventing severe illness and death from omicron, the rates of omicron breakthrough infection among vaccinated people have been high, which suggests that although immunity induced by index virus-based vaccines is sufficient to prevent severe disease, it is not sufficient to prevent Omicron infection. The goal of an update in vaccine strain composition for COVID-19 is to broaden immunological cross-reactivity against newly emerged VOCs while preserving reactivity to current and earlier circulating strains, rather than an attempt to match the vaccine composition to what is circulating. This can be achieved as a booster dose and/or through the use of a multivalent vaccine.

Immunological profiles are increasingly heterogeneous, and so the performance of an updated vaccine will vary depending on the nature and magnitude of previously acquired immunity in each person. Therefore, future vaccine composition decisions will need to be made in the face of increasingly complex and heterogeneous data.

Index virus-based vaccines are available across different platforms, including mRNA-based, viral vectored, and inactivated, and they elicit robust systemic immunity that protects against severe disease caused by all variants, including omicron. However, a preponderance of vaccine effectiveness data is derived from mRNA-based vaccines. So far, available vaccines with an updated composition are predominantly mRNA-based, although others are likely to follow. The paucity of data from vaccines other than those based on mRNA technology is problematic, given the diversity of vaccines in use globally.

Since January 2022, there has been a substantial reduction in SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing and sequencing globally, as well as in the number of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences submitted to open access databases, such as GISAID EpiCov. The reduction in availability of genetic sequence data will delay the identification and phenotypic assessment of new variants needed to understand the effect of variants on vaccine effectiveness and therapeutic agents. Therefore, efforts to sustain SARS-CoV-2 genetic surveillance capacity must be accompanied by phenotypic analysis of the variants.

Decisions on vaccine antigen composition require extensive evaluation of the neutralizing capacity of well-characterized human convalescent sera, which are obtained from naive and previously vaccinated individuals, including after infection with VOCs and descendent lineages, well-characterized panels of human monoclonal antibodies, and sera from naive, infected and vaccinated animal models.

The current approach to vaccine antigen composition may not be sustainable in the long term, given the length of time for vaccine development, the paucity of surveillance data globally, and the regulatory requirements in different countries. Future development of vaccines that protect against all SARS-CoV-2 variants, pan SARS, and all sarbecoviruses will be technically challenging but could offer protection from diverse coronaviruses, including those that are enzootic in many animal species.

[Three countries reported more than 100 000 cases in the week between 15 and 22 Feb 2023: USA (219 226), Japan (116 400), and Taiwan (108 829). Countries reporting more than 10 000 cases during the same period were Russia (96 957), Germany (94 428), South Korea (74 156), Brazil (36 440), Austria (35 099), Italy (28 347), France (26 101), UK (25 632), Mexico (24 973), Australia (17 356), Poland (12 668), Chile (11 657), Greece (11 188), and Canada (10 710).

Daily and weekly case numbers reflect the size of COVID-19 epidemics and testing/reporting requirements in each country or territory. These may vary based on national or local responses and anti-epidemic measures in place during the reporting period. In general, there is significant underreporting of cases worldwide and likely to be driven by the testing of medically attended, symptomatic cases. It is also becoming less likely for asymptomatic or mild cases to be tested by medical professionals and for individuals to self-test via rapid antigen testing unless it is required for work or travel. All these factors contribute to the underreporting of cases in various locations to a different degree. - Mod.LWW]

The Ghana Health Service (GHS) reported today [26 Feb 2023] 2 confirmed Lassa fever cases from the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research on Friday [24 Feb 2023]. Both cases reside in Accra.

The 1st case was a 40 year old trader, who was unwell for about 2 weeks and died at the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital. The 2nd case, who is a contact of the fatal case, is currently a hospital inpatient and is in a stable condition. To date, 56 contacts have been identified and are being followed up.

Ghana is one of the West African countries where Lassa fever is endemic, along with Benin, Liberia, Guinea, Nigeria, Mali, Sierra Leone, and Togo.

Lassa fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic fever spread through contact with infected rodents or their urine or droppings. Lassa fever can also be spread from person to person through contact with an infected person's bodily fluids.

Symptoms of Lassa fever (fever, chills, headache, and fatigue) develop 1-3 weeks after infection. About 20% of people infected with Lassa fever develop severe illness that can lead to hemorrhaging (bleeding), respiratory distress, vomiting, facial swelling, pain in the chest, back, and abdomen, and sometimes death.

[It is not clear if the 2nd case was in contact with the 1st one in the hospital or outside it. Transmission of the virus can occur when in contact with the excrement of infected rodent hosts or with infected individuals as sometimes happens in hospitals. Although Lassa fever virus (LFV) is endemic in West Africa, including Ghana, cases occur sporadically there. It has been 5 years since the previous LFV ProMED post from Ghana when a case was diagnosed in 2018. Interestingly, LFV in Ghana was predicted many years ago. In commenting on the 2011 cases in Ghana, the late Mod.CP said that Lassa virus infection had not been recorded previously in Ghana, but the lesser prevalence of Lassa fever in Ghana was predicted by a spatial-climatic analysis of Lassa fever data from human cases and infected rodent hosts in West Africa during the period 1965-2007 (see Risk maps of Lassa fever in West Africa. PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2009; 3(3): e388; <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19255625/> and also the ProMED-mail archived report: Lassa fever, predictive maps - West Africa 20090428.1605).

Halting the acquisition of Lassa fever virus infection at its source -- at the village level -- is not easy. As noted previously, getting local people to understand that virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_), or its excreta can be difficult. Preventing this contact requires understanding that leads to action. Rodent control and prevention of contact with rodent excreta have to be undertaken at the village level with individual households. This requires an extensive and continuous public education effort. Transmission of the virus also occurs in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed and barrier-nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from the blood and secretions of infected patients. Although no vaccine is available, ribavirin has been used to successfully treat patients and is most effective if patients are treated early in the course of infection.

[1] Israel (Safed): AFP polio suspected, RFI

Israel's Health Ministry announces that a case of polio has been diagnosed in an unvaccinated child in Safed. The child was brought into a local hospital with weakness in his limbs and was tested, leading to the diagnosis.

Health officials are now looking into the child's contacts to identify any others who may have been affected.

Polio is a viral disease that mainly affects children and can cause disability, paralysis, and death. Today, polio vaccinations are standard for children and are an effective preventive measure, but vaccine skepticism has enabled the disease to pop up from time to time.

The child arrived at the hospital with limb weakness and after an inquiry at the National Virus Laboratory, the sample was found to be positive for the polio virus.

There are about 150 000 unvaccinated children in Israel and there is evidence of the continued existence of polio in the sewers in many communities.

The Ministry of Health mentions that the main way to protect children from paralysis is through a killed polio vaccine. To prevent transmission of the virus it is important to maintain hand hygiene.

The district health bureau will open an epidemiological investigation and contact close contacts of the child to provide specific instructions. According to the findings of the investigation, a decision will be made on additional recommendations. The Ministry of Health will continue monitoring and update the findings.

Polio is a virus that causes paralysis in children, which has been eradicated from many countries in the world thanks to effective and safe vaccines that have been known for decades. No child in the State of Israel in 2023 should suffer from polio. A vaccinated child is a protected child.

Polio is a virus that causes paralysis in children, which has been eradicated from many countries in the world thanks to effective and safe vaccines that have been known for decades. About a month ago [January 2023], members of a delegation from the World Health Organization arrived in Israel, touring countries with ongoing polio outbreaks, with the aim of examining the ways of coping in Israel, sampling, monitoring, and vaccination. The polio outbreak in Israel began in February 2022, when a Jerusalem girl arrived at hospital with paralysis. Since then there has been evidence of continued circulation of the virus, by its detection in sewers in various cities throughout the country.

Dr Sharon Elroei Price, head of public health services at the Ministry of Health, explained to Walla that there is no reason to worry about the special delegation that arrived in Israel, but about the disease itself: ""Most children who are infected do not develop symptoms, in 20% of cases there are symptoms of a viral disease, and in less than 1% of cases in unvaccinated children there can be paralysis. From 2013 there was no evidence of polio in Israel until the case of the Jerusalem girl.""

[This report was originally found in English as a live blog on the Times of Israel website (section [1A] above. According to a brief report in The Jerusalem Post the affected child is 8 years old and lives near the city of Safed. ""An investigation will be conducted among the child's close family and friends to verify the diagnosis."" (<https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-732873>)

From the reports available it appears as though this is a case of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) suspected to be caused by poliovirus, with the Ministry of Health having issued an early official alert. One wonders if there were positive environmental samples in the early results of the epidemiologic investigation.

As a reminder, one AFP case in Jerusalem Israel was reported in March 2022, associated with a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 3 (cVDPV3) infection (see prior posts in the see also section below). In addition, a vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (VDPV2) was identified in wastewater sampling matching the VDPV2's identified in wastewater in the USA and the UK in August of 2022.

In 2013 positive environmental samples of WPV1 were identified at first in the south of Israel and moving north. No AFP cases were associated with this event (see 2013 ProMED polio posts below). At that time Israel had been using inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) alone for vaccination. To stop the ongoing transmission of wild polivirus (WPV), oral polio vaccine (OPV) was reintroduced to the vaccination program as a mixed schedule -- IPV followed by OPV.

We await further information.

Safed has a long and rich history through millennia. It is located in the northern Galilee in Israel and is the highest city in the country (<https://www.touristisrael.com/safed/5681/>). It is considered a holy city in Judaism. It was a refuge for the 1492 Spanish expulsion Sephardic population. It was said to have been originally founded by one of Noah's sons after the Flood.

""The Jerusalem Talmud mentions Safed as one of 5 elevated spots where fires were lit to announce the New Moon and festivals during the Second Temple period."" ""The city today has a large Haredi community and remains a center for Jewish religious studies.""
(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safed>) The mention of a sizable Haredi community may well mean a sizeable pocket of unvaccinated children and young adults.

The San Carlos City government in Negros Occidental province has declared a state of health emergency after reports of an increase in amebiasis [amoebiasis] cases last week. San Carlos City mayor Renato Gustilo said ""alarming concerns on the rising cases of amebiasis"" prompted him to issue Executive Order (EO) No. 79 declaring a state of health of emergency.

Nearly 200 amebiasis cases have been reported in 10 barangays (villages) from January (90) to February (100) [2023]. Gustilo said since Tuesday [27 Feb 2023], the City Health Office and the San Carlos City Hospital have been advising residents through social media to be cautious of the surge in amebiasis cases. EO 79 noted that anyone, young or old, is prone to contracting food and waterborne diseases such as cholera, diarrhea, typhoid fever, and amoebiasis.

Amoebiasis is a disease caused by the parasite _Entamoeba histolytica_. It can affect anyone, although it is commoner in people who live in tropical areas with poor sanitary conditions. People mostly get infected with the parasite from ingestion of fecally contaminated food and water containing the amoebic cysts. Transmission can also occur through oral-anal contact with a chronically ill or asymptomatic carrier.

According to the United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), only about 10% to 20% of people who are infected with _E. histolytica_ become sick from the infection. Of those who do become sick, symptoms may include stomach pain, bloody stools, and fever. Rarely, _E. histolytica_ invades the liver and forms an abscess (a collection of pus). In a small number of instances, it has been shown to spread to other parts of the body, such as the lungs or brain, but this is very uncommon.

The number of amoebiasis cases in San Carlos City, Negros Occidental, continues to increase with 230 cases recorded as of yesterday [26 Feb 2023] morning. The patients are currently admitted at the San Carlos City Hospital, said mayor Renato Gustilo.

Amoebiasis is an intestinal illness caused by microscopic parasite _Entamoeba histolytica_, which is spread through human feces. Symptoms include nausea, diarrhea, weight loss, stomach tenderness, and occasional fever.

Gustilo declared a state of health emergency just this 23 Feb [2023]. ""Alarming concerns on the rising cases of amoebiasis"" prompted him to issue Executive Order (EO) No. 79 declaring an emergency. The city mayor also confirmed that yesterday [26 Feb 2023] 7 inmates at the San Carlos City District Jail were also hospitalized due to amoebiasis. A subsequent inspection and water test at the jail, however, proved negative for amoeba bacteria.

Gustilo scheduled a meeting with the San Carlos Water Works to discuss ways to address the rising amoebiasis cases. Water sampling of households, especially those with positive cases, has been stepped up. The city's main line water system has also been subjected to laboratory tests, which ""unofficially"" detected presence of the amoeba. The samples have been sent to an accredited laboratory in Bacolod City for further verification, and the results are expected to be released on Fri 3 Mar [2023].

In the meantime, Gustilo advised the city's residents to use bottled water or boil water first before drinking. Amoebiasis can be prevented by boiling water for drinking; keeping surroundings clean; washing hands after using the toilet and before eating; and maintaining proper personal and food hygiene.

[Amoebiasis due to _Entamoeba histolytica_ infection is one of the commonest parasitic diseases globally, and yet is considered a neglected disease. Amoebiasis is most prevalent in impoverished communities with poor sanitation. Waterborne outbreaks of amoebiasis are very rare. In a recent review of waterborne protozoan outbreaks worldwide from 2017-2020, the vast majority were due to cryptosporidium and giardia, with only one reported outbreak due to _E. histolytica_ [1].

As with many other developing countries, the Philippines has challenges providing clean water to the population, particularly in rural areas with irrigation needs that may also be experiencing rapid urbanization. In a limited study of urban and rural areas around Metro Manila, the free-living amoebae _Acanthamoeba_ spp and _Naegleria_ spp were readily detected in fresh water and potential drinking water sources, but not _E. histolytica_ [2]. However, both _E. histolytica_ and _Entamoeba dispar_ have been detected at very low levels in residents of a Manila slum using stool ELISA and PCR [3,4]. These methods are useful in distinguishing _E. histolytica_ from _Entamoeba dispar_, which is a non-pathogenic intestinal commensal.

Negros Occidental is a province that occupies the north western portion of the large island of Negros in the Western Visayas region of the Philippine archipelago. Cholera cases have been increasing since October 2022 in a number of cities in the northern part of the province (see, for example <https://www.philstar.com/nation/2022/12/21/2232243/negros-occidental-cholera-cases-still-rising>), which is where San Carlos City is located. The rising incidence of cholera may well indicate deficiencies in the provision and use of clean water in this region.

Despite the rarity of waterborne outbreaks of amoebiasis, the very large cluster of cases and other features of the current outbreak in San Carlos City, as reported in the news articles above, are compatible with an outbreak of intestinal amoebiasis from a contaminated water source. That a number of these patients have been hospitalized suggests a significant incidence of severe amoebic dysentery and dehydration. The second report above suggests that the city's main water line system tested positive for ""amoeba"", with further identification pending. ProMED would welcome information that clarifies links between this outbreak, presumably due to _E. histolytica_, to one or more contaminated water sources.

Q fever has been detected in several people in Amt Neuhaus (Lüneburg district). It is a disease that can be transmitted from animals to humans and can manifest itself with flu-like symptoms. ""Some are clinically ill; others may not have any symptoms,"" district spokeswoman Marion Junker said on Monday [27 Feb 2023]. ""It's a disease that's coming up from the south because of climate change.""

Q fever is a disease caused by the bacterium _Coxiella burnetii_. People can become infected by inhaling small droplets or dust. There have been cases where infection could be detected at 2 km [1.2 mi] distance from sick animals: direct contact with animals is therefore not always necessary. Nevertheless, according to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), people who have close contact with animals, such as butchers, animal fur processors, animal keepers, and veterinary staff, are more at risk than others. There is also a hazard for laboratory personnel.

In animals, an infection can be asymptomatic, so that without regular sampling, animal owners do not necessarily notice when their animals are ill. Infections reported in Germany have increased, especially since 1995.

[Lüneburg is a district in Lower Saxony, north west Germany, bordering the Netherlands. We are informed that no official notification of the event has yet been published, while local authorities are planning a meeting to give overall information to the public and the medical profession.

Query (Q) fever (or coxiellosis), a zoonotic disease notifiable to the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH), occurs in most countries. Humans generally acquire infection through airborne transmission from animal reservoirs, especially from domestic ruminants, but other domestic and wildlife animals (pets, rabbits, birds, etc) can be involved. The causal agent is the obligate intracellular bacterium, _Coxiella burnetii_, which displays different morphological forms in its developmental cycle. Some forms can survive extracellularly and even accumulate in the environment.

Abortions in _C. burnetii_-infected domestic ruminants are accompanied by massive excretion of the bacteria that spread into the environment. This is the most important excretion route of _C. burnetii_, as up to 109 organisms are excreted per gram of placenta tissue. (see WOAH terrestrial manual at <https://www.woah.org/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.01.17_Q_FEVER.pdf>).

In Europe, the first cases of Q fever in humans were reported from German soldiers in Greece in June 1941, and subsequently in Germany shortly after World War II, and in the Netherlands in 1956. Human cases and outbreaks are attributed to infection in sheep and goats. Abortion in cattle is a less prominent feature of infection compared with that in sheep and goats, and considered less likely to shed the pathogen. It was speculated that the prominent role of sheep and goats as reservoirs of infection during human outbreaks might be related to the highly seasonal nature of their reproduction cycle, to the larger herd sizes in these species, to differences in management and housing between these species, to the relative importance of shedding and abortions after _C. burnetii_ infection, and possibly to species-related differences in the virulence for humans of _C. burnetii_. Some of the above information is derived from a review addressing Q fever in 4 European countries, undertaken by European Union experts in the aftermath of the major Q fever epidemic in the Netherlands, considered to be the largest community outbreak ever recorded (see Georgiev M, Afonso A, Neubauer H, et al. Q fever in humans and farm animals in 4 European countries, 1982 to 2010. Euro Surveill. 2013; 18(8): pii=20407; <https://doi.org/10.2807/ese.18.08.20407-en>).

The Dutch event involved a cluster of 4026 human cases, notified between 2007 and 2010 (ProMED post 20100930.3546). This outbreak was clearly linked to a dairy goat farm with more than 400 adult goats, where an abortion wave due to _C. burnetii_ was confirmed, starting a few weeks before the first human cases were seen. The said event, and others -- of smaller dimensions, in the Netherlands and in several German states -- were associated with urban areas. Proximity to farm animals and contact with infected animals or their birth products have been identified as the most important risk factors for human disease. Intrinsic farm factors, such as production systems and management, influence the number of outbreaks in an area.

Prompted by the outbreak of Q fever in the Netherlands, concerns were raised by the European Commission about factors contributing to the development of large, sustained Q fever outbreaks.

The statement about Q fever ""coming up from the south because of climate change"" is in need of clarification. An epidemiological investigation, involving public and animal health investigators, is warranted. - Mod.AS

Humans usually become infected by inhaling aerosolized _C. burnetii_; intermittent high-level shedding occurs at the time of parturition, with millions of bacteria being released per gram of placenta. _C. burnetii_ can be dispersed for a considerable distance in agricultural regions via airborne particles containing _C. burnetii_ to involve people living downwind from infected livestock. Widespread transmission of Q fever was documented in the Netherlands downwind from the index farm, a single dairy-goat farm, even beyond a 5 km (3 mi) high-risk zone (<https://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/55/12/1591.long#T2>).

Ingestion of contaminated unpasteurized milk or milk products is a less common mode of transmission (<https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25692216/>). Rarely, Q fever has been spread person to person through blood transfusion; from a pregnant woman to her fetus; or through sex, infected breast milk, clustered familial cases, and nosocomial infection during delivery or autopsies (<https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/58/11/e146/2895430> and <https://www.cdc.gov/qfever/transmission/index.html>). In 2014, a Q fever outbreak occurred in Canadian and US travelers to Germany, where they received live sheep cell therapy (see ProMED post 20170416.4974554).

Although often asymptomatic, the infection can present acutely 2-3 weeks after exposure as atypical pneumonia or hepatitis, or as a chronic disease (mainly endocarditis/endarteritis) (<http://cmr.asm.org/content/12/4/518.short>). The patients at highest risk for chronic Q fever are those with pre-existing valvular heart disease, a vascular graft, an arterial aneurysm, and pregnancy (<https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6203a1.htm>). Unusual complications include glomerulonephritis and rhabdomyolysis (<http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08860220701460178>). Post-Q fever fatigue syndrome has been reported in up to 20% of patients with acute Q fever.

During pregnancy, Q fever may result in obstetric complications, such as placental infection, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine growth retardation, intrauterine fetal death, premature delivery, and maternal chronic Q fever (<https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/45/5/548/273863>).

Diagnosis of Q fever can usually be confirmed by serology (<https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/qfever/>). In acute Q fever, phase II antibodies are usually much higher than phase I antibodies and are detectable by indirect immunofluorescence 2 to 3 weeks after onset of illness. In chronic Q fever, phase I antibody titers are much greater than phase II titers. Phase I antibody titers of 1:800 or higher are considered diagnostic in endocarditis patients for chronic Q fever.

Tetracyclines are considered the antibiotics of choice for treatment of acute Q fever. Q fever endocarditis is treated with the combination of doxycycline plus hydroxychloroquine for at least 18 months (<https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/414865>).

A human vaccine for Q fever is used in Australia, but it is not available in the United States. In Australia, Q fever vaccination is recommended for those working in ""at-risk"" occupations such as abattoir workers, farmers, stockyard workers, shearers, animal transporters, and others exposed to cattle, camels, sheep, goats, and kangaroos or their products (including products of conception), veterinarians, veterinary nurses, veterinary students, professional dog and cat breeders, agricultural college staff and students, wildlife and zoo workers (working with high risk animals), and laboratory personnel handling veterinary specimens or working with the organism (<https://immunisationhandbook.health.gov.au/vaccine-preventable-diseases/q-fever>). - Mod.ML

It was speculated that the prominent role of sheep and goats as reservoirs of infection during human outbreaks might be related to the highly seasonal nature of their reproduction cycle, to the larger herd sizes in these species, to differences in management and housing between these species, to the relative importance of shedding and abortions after _C. burnetii_ infection, and possibly to species-related differences in the virulence for humans of _C. burnetii_. Some of the above information is derived from a review addressing Q fever in 4 European countries, undertaken by European Union experts in the aftermath of the major Q fever epidemic in the Netherlands, considered to be the largest community outbreak ever recorded (see Georgiev M, Afonso A, Neubauer H, et al. Q fever in humans and farm animals in 4 European countries, 1982 to 2010. Euro Surveill. 2013; 18(8): pii=20407; <https://doi.org/10.2807/ese.18.08.20407-en>).The Dutch event involved a cluster of 4026 human cases, notified between 2007 and 2010 (ProMED post 20100930.3546). This outbreak was clearly linked to a dairy goat farm with more than 400 adult goats, where an abortion wave due to _C. burnetii_ was confirmed, starting a few weeks before the first human cases were seen. The said event, and others -- of smaller dimensions, in the Netherlands and in several German states -- were associated with urban areas. Proximity to farm animals and contact with infected animals or their birth products have been identified as the most important risk factors for human disease. Intrinsic farm factors, such as production systems and management, influence the number of outbreaks in an area.Prompted by the outbreak of Q fever in the Netherlands, concerns were raised by the European Commission about factors contributing to the development of large, sustained Q fever outbreaks.The statement about Q fever ""coming up from the south because of climate change"" is in need of clarification. An epidemiological investigation, involving public and animal health investigators, is warranted. - Mod.ASHumans usually become infected by inhaling aerosolized _C. burnetii_; intermittent high-level shedding occurs at the time of parturition, with millions of bacteria being released per gram of placenta. _C. burnetii_ can be dispersed for a considerable distance in agricultural regions via airborne particles containing _C. burnetii_ to involve people living downwind from infected livestock. Widespread transmission of Q fever was documented in the Netherlands downwind from the index farm, a single dairy-goat farm, even beyond a 5 km (3 mi) high-risk zone (<https://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/55/12/1591.long#T2>).Ingestion of contaminated unpasteurized milk or milk products is a less common mode of transmission (<https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25692216/>). Rarely, Q fever has been spread person to person through blood transfusion; from a pregnant woman to her fetus; or through sex, infected breast milk, clustered familial cases, and nosocomial infection during delivery or autopsies (<https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/58/11/e146/2895430> and <https://www.cdc.gov/qfever/transmission/index.html>). In 2014, a Q fever outbreak occurred in Canadian and US travelers to Germany, where they received live sheep cell therapy (see ProMED post 20170416.4974554).Although often asymptomatic, the infection can present acutely 2-3 weeks after exposure as atypical pneumonia or hepatitis, or as a chronic disease (mainly endocarditis/endarteritis) (<http://cmr.asm.org/content/12/4/518.short>). The patients at highest risk for chronic Q fever are those with pre-existing valvular heart disease, a vascular graft, an arterial aneurysm, and pregnancy (<https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6203a1.htm>). Unusual complications include glomerulonephritis and rhabdomyolysis (<http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08860220701460178>). Post-Q fever fatigue syndrome has been reported in up to 20% of patients with acute Q fever.During pregnancy, Q fever may result in obstetric complications, such as placental infection, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine growth retardation, intrauterine fetal death, premature delivery, and maternal chronic Q fever (<https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/45/5/548/273863>).Diagnosis of Q fever can usually be confirmed by serology (<https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/qfever/>). In acute Q fever, phase II antibodies are usually much higher than phase I antibodies and are detectable by indirect immunofluorescence 2 to 3 weeks after onset of illness. In chronic Q fever, phase I antibody titers are much greater than phase II titers. Phase I antibody titers of 1:800 or higher are considered diagnostic in endocarditis patients for chronic Q fever.Tetracyclines are considered the antibiotics of choice for treatment of acute Q fever. Q fever endocarditis is treated with the combination of doxycycline plus hydroxychloroquine for at least 18 months (<https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/414865>).A human vaccine for Q fever is used in Australia, but it is not available in the United States. In Australia, Q fever vaccination is recommended for those working in ""at-risk"" occupations such as abattoir workers, farmers, stockyard workers, shearers, animal transporters, and others exposed to cattle, camels, sheep, goats, and kangaroos or their products (including products of conception), veterinarians, veterinary nurses, veterinary students, professional dog and cat breeders, agricultural college staff and students, wildlife and zoo workers (working with high risk animals), and laboratory personnel handling veterinary specimens or working with the organism (<https://immunisationhandbook.health.gov.au/vaccine-preventable-diseases/q-fever>). - Mod.MLProMED map of Lower Saxony, Germany: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8708632,2856>.]",Hamburger Morgenpost,,

About 120 cases of measles had been recorded in the Northern region by end of December 2022 due to the shortage of essential vaccines, the Paediatric Society of Ghana has disclosed.

Dr Agyeiwaa Boundie, a member of the Paediatric Society of Ghana in a discussion on Citi TV on [Sat 25 Feb 2023], has implored the government to ensure that the country never runs out of vaccines for children. ""A total of 120 cases of measles were recorded in the Northern Region. So that tells you the situation is severe. Many of the children were either not vaccinated or didn't know their vaccination status. This has happened and this should never happen again. Our children are vulnerable ... this should never happen in our nation again.""

The Ghana Health Service (GHS) has attributed the shortage of vaccines used for routine immunization of babies to the depreciation of the Ghana Cedi (currently 1 USD is equivalent to about 12.7 Ghanaian Cedis).

Under the routine vaccination program, Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG), a vaccine for tuberculosis (TB) disease; oral polio vaccine 0 (OPV); measles-rubella; meningitis and diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough) are administered. Vaccines against polio, hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenza type B (DPT/Hep B/ Hib 1) and 6 infectious diseases that are particularly dangerous to babies are also among those administered.

The shortage of vaccines has the potential to increase the vulnerability of children to the diseases the vaccines seek to protect them against.

In the midst of a growing measles outbreak in the Cape Metro, the City of Cape Town's health department is urging parents to vaccinate their children. The outbreak was declared by The National Institute for Communicable Diseases. The most recent number of measles cases in 6 affected provinces has risen past 600, a tally that cites this as SA's worst outbreak in more than a decade.

A national measles vaccination campaign is under way, which kicked off after an outbreak in 5 other provinces. Children between the ages of 6 months and 14 years and 11 months will receive an additional measles vaccination at public schools, crèches and City of Cape Town clinics. Since [6 Feb 2023], 168 056 measles vaccines have been administered across the province to children in this age group.

""The vaccine is safe and provides lifelong immunity against the disease. We can protect our children from serious complications of measles such as diarrhoea, dehydration, middle-ear infection, brain infection (encephalitis), blindness, and even death,"" said the city's mayoral committee member for community services and health, Patricia Van der Ross.

City Health staff are visiting public schools and crèches to drop off the measles campaign pamphlets and consent forms. ""Parents and caregivers are urged to complete the consent form for their children as they cannot be vaccinated without consent. Children can also be taken to their nearest clinic for vaccination. The measles vaccine is very effective at preventing measles, and with a declared outbreak, it is our duty to ensure our children are protected,"" said Van der Ross.

If a child is absent from creche or school on vaccination day, parents or caregivers can take the child to their nearest clinic where the additional measles vaccine will be administered. Currently, children receive the first measles vaccination at the age of 6 months and the 2nd one at 12 months, as part of the national immunisation schedule. The vaccine is free at all City clinics.

A case of measles has been confirmed in a Jessamine County resident who attended the spiritual revival at Asbury University on [Sat 18 Feb 2023], and Kentucky public health officials warned that people who attended the event that day may have been exposed. The resident was not vaccinated against the respiratory virus, the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services said in a news release on [Fri 24 Feb 2023]. 

The state said no other information will be released about the person. ""Anyone who attended the revival on [18 Feb 2023] may have been exposed to measles,"" Dr Steven Stack, commissioner of the Kentucky Department for Public Health said in the news release. ""Attendees who are unvaccinated are encouraged to quarantine for 21 days and to seek immunization with the measles vaccine, which is safe and effective.""

The Jessamine County Health Department said in a Facebook post that it is working with health officials at Asbury to coordinate a measles vaccine clinic next week [w/e 5 Mar 2023].

Anyone who might have been exposed at Asbury who develops symptoms was asked to isolate from others and call their ""medical provider, urgent care, or emergency department to seek testing"", regardless of whether they have been vaccinated, Stack said. ""Please do not arrive at a health care facility without advance notice so that others will not be exposed,"" he said.

The state said it is collaborating with Asbury, the Jessamine County Health Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""All reported cases of measles are thoroughly investigated in Kentucky,"" the release stated.

The Cabinet for Health and Family Services said this is the 3rd case of measles in Kentucky in 3 months. The first was confirmed in Christian County in December and was linked to an outbreak in Ohio that sickened more than 80 children. The other case was reported in Powell County last month and did not have any known connections to the Ohio outbreak. The state said each of those cases was investigated and determined not to pose a threat to public health.

Children typically get their first dose of the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps, and rubella, between 12 and 15 months of age, and a 2nd dose is administered between ages 4 and 6 years. The Kentucky Department for Public Health said it is working with local health departments to encourage MMR vaccination in areas with lower vaccination rates. Recently released data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate that Kentucky's rate of MMR vaccination among kindergarten students is among the lowest in the United States.

Kentucky residents can check their vaccination records through the Kentucky Immunization Registry Public Portal.

Measles is a highly contagious respiratory virus that is spread through the air. A small number of cases are capable of quickly producing epidemics in high-risk, unvaccinated populations. For measles, R0 is often cited to be 12-18, which means that each person with measles would, on average, infect 12-18 other people in a totally susceptible population. But this number will vary depending on local conditions and level of pre-existing immunity. Mass events such as the one described above lend themselves to rapid virus spread. - Mod.LK

Since early February [2023], the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) and many wildlife rehabilitation centers have received increased reports of sick and dead band-tailed pigeons from residents. Most reports have come from locations along California's Central Coast, the San Francisco Bay Area and foothill communities in the Sierra Nevada Mountains.

CDFW's Wildlife Health Laboratory has evaluated birds from several locations and determined the cause of death to be avian trichomonosis [ProMED uses the synonymous term ""trichomoniasis""], a disease caused by a protozoan parasite, typically _Trichomonas gallinae_. Statewide, its estimated that roughly 200-300 band-tailed pigeons may have died of this infection so far this winter.

""Avian trichomonosis outbreaks occur periodically in band-tailed pigeons during some winters in California,"" said CDFW senior environmental scientist Krysta Rogers, an avian disease specialist. ""Historically, larger outbreaks generally have been associated with drier conditions because the pigeons may be more likely to share a reduced number of water sources and the parasite can spread more rapidly among birds in the flock.""

Band-tailed pigeons are native to California and may be unfamiliar to some residents given their mostly secretive and highly nomadic lifestyle. During winter, nearly the entire Pacific Coast population of band-tailed pigeons congregates in areas of Central to Southern California, sometimes forming relatively large flocks and seeking out acorns, their preferred food in winter.

The parasite that causes avian trichomonosis is primarily spread in water sources such as bird baths, fountains, and horse or cattle troughs where the parasite may become more concentrated. Once infected, caseous lesions (""cheese-like"") may develop in the bird's mouth or throat leading to starvation or suffocation. Sick birds may appear weak, swallow repeatedly, have labored breathing, and may sit for prolonged periods. Severely affected birds may develop neurological signs such as lack of coordination or twisting of the head or neck. Band-tailed pigeons are especially susceptible to avian trichomonosis. Other bird species also may be susceptible when sharing water sources as are avian predators that may feed on infected birds.

Residents can help reduce disease transmission among birds by removing bird feeders and bird baths and emptying fountains while the pigeons are in their area. Observations of sick and dead pigeons may be reported to CDFW using the mortality reporting form. These reports are important to help document when and where birds may be impacted.

If there is a need to dispose of a dead bird, CDFW recommends wearing disposable gloves to collect the remains into a plastic bag, which may then be placed in the regular trash collection. Afterward, wash hands with soap and water. For guidance on orphaned, injured or sick live-wild birds, please contact your nearest wildlife rehabilitation center before collecting the animal.

[_Trichomonas gallinae_ is a common protozoan parasite of pigeons (Columbiformes) which principally infects the upper alimentary tract where it can cause necrotic ingluvitis. Epidemic mortalities in columbiform species are sporadically reported, and the parasite may infect other avian taxa such as birds of prey and songbirds. - Mod.PMB

""Historically, larger outbreaks generally have been associated with drier conditions because the pigeons may be more likely to share a reduced number of water sources and the parasite can spread more rapidly among birds in the flock.""Band-tailed pigeons are native to California and may be unfamiliar to some residents given their mostly secretive and highly nomadic lifestyle. During winter, nearly the entire Pacific Coast population of band-tailed pigeons congregates in areas of Central to Southern California, sometimes forming relatively large flocks and seeking out acorns, their preferred food in winter.The parasite that causes avian trichomonosis is primarily spread in water sources such as bird baths, fountains, and horse or cattle troughs where the parasite may become more concentrated. Once infected, caseous lesions (""cheese-like"") may develop in the bird's mouth or throat leading to starvation or suffocation. Sick birds may appear weak, swallow repeatedly, have labored breathing, and may sit for prolonged periods. Severely affected birds may develop neurological signs such as lack of coordination or twisting of the head or neck. Band-tailed pigeons are especially susceptible to avian trichomonosis. Other bird species also may be susceptible when sharing water sources as are avian predators that may feed on infected birds.Residents can help reduce disease transmission among birds by removing bird feeders and bird baths and emptying fountains while the pigeons are in their area. Observations of sick and dead pigeons may be reported to CDFW using the mortality reporting form. These reports are important to help document when and where birds may be impacted.If there is a need to dispose of a dead bird, CDFW recommends wearing disposable gloves to collect the remains into a plastic bag, which may then be placed in the regular trash collection. Afterward, wash hands with soap and water. For guidance on orphaned, injured or sick live-wild birds, please contact your nearest wildlife rehabilitation center before collecting the animal.--communicated by:ProMED rapporteur Mahmoud Orabi[_Trichomonas gallinae_ is a common protozoan parasite of pigeons (Columbiformes) which principally infects the upper alimentary tract where it can cause necrotic ingluvitis.

The H5N1 bird flu virus, which is the leading cause of death of a girl in Roleang village, Romlech commune, Sithor Kandal district, is the most common bird flu virus [strain] in Cambodia during the last few years:
- The H5N1 avian influenza virus (clade 2.3.2.1c) is different from the H5N1 bird flu virus in other parts of the world.
- The follow-up on disease cases continues, while populations associated with patients continue to be monitored.
- To date, no human-to-human transmission of the H5N1 bird flu virus has been reported.

May all citizens avoid direct contact with sick or dead birds. Please join in protecting and preventing together for our health.

The viruses that infected 2 people in Cambodia with H5N1 avian influenza have been identified as an endemic clade of bird flu circulating in the country, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said.

The cases reported last week had raised concerns they were caused by a new strain of H5N1, clade 2.3.4.4b, which emerged in 2020 and has caused record numbers of deaths among wild birds and domestic poultry in recent months.

But work so far suggests this is not the case.

Preliminary genetic sequencing carried out in Cambodia led its health ministry to identify the viruses as H5 clade 2.3.2.1c, which has circulated in Cambodia among birds and poultry for many years and has sporadically caused infections in people, the CDC said in a statement on Saturday [25 Feb 2023].

""Yes, this is an older clade of avian influenza that had been circulating around the region for a number of years and while it has caused human infections in the past, it has not been seen to cause human-to-human transmission. However, that doesn't mean that the threat is any less,"" said Erik Karlsson, director of the National Influenza Center of Cambodia and acting head of virology at the Institut Pasteur du Cambodge, which sequenced the virus.

He added that the response needed to be coordinated and swift to prevent any further spread and to limit exposure to any common source.

An investigation into the source and to detect any additional cases is ongoing, the CDC said, adding that so far there had been no indication of person-to-person spread.

Cambodia tested at least 12 people for the H5N1 strain last week, after an 11-year-old girl died from the virus in the first known transmission to humans in the country in nearly a decade.

The victim's father, who was part of a group the girl had been in contact with in a province east of the capital Phnom Penh, tested positive for the virus but did not exhibit any symptoms, Cambodia's Health Minister Mam Bunheng had said in a statement on Friday [25 Feb 2023].

Only the girl's case has been sequenced and the father's case is still being worked on, Karlsson said.

The World Health Organization said it is working with Cambodian authorities following the cases, describing the situation as worrying due to the recent rise in cases in birds and mammals.

The Ministry of Health has just stated that 29 people tested for Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) in a village in Prey Veng province -- where an 11 year old girl died on Wednesday [22 Feb 2023] -- have all tested negative for the virus.

Dr. Yok Sambath, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Health, said that the H5N1 test results were conducted by the Institut Pasteur and the Institute of Public Health last night.

""Despite the negative results of all the bird flu cases, all of our officials continue to work with local authorities, not just in Prey Veng, we educate all over the country, to raise awareness and disseminate bird flu education spots on television, community and social media,"" she said.

""In addition, our emergency response officers are continuing to monitor Prey Veng, as well as other provinces, to make sure that the disease does not spread to other provinces, so we have tested directly on stakeholders and the results is negative, including the father [of the deceased girl, who had earlier tested positive for H5N1], he is now negative, and others we are continuing to research and educate people to implement health measures.

The outbreak was announced earlier this week after an 11 year old girl from Roleang village, Romlech commune, Sithor Kandal district, Prey Veng province died of the virus. It was the 1st death in Cambodia from the virus for 10 years. In response, Cambodia's neighbours Thailand and Vietnam have raised alert levels in provinces bordering Cambodia. The WHO said it was in close contact with the Cambodian authorities about the situation, including regarding the test results of the girl's other contacts.

Influenza A virus subtype H5N1 (A/H5N1) is a subtype of the influenza A virus which can cause illness in humans and many other animal species. A bird-adapted strain of H5N1, called HPAI A(H5N1) for highly pathogenic avian influenza virus of type A of subtype H5N1, is the highly pathogenic causative agent of H5N1 flu, commonly known as avian influenza (""bird flu""). It is enzootic (maintained in the population) in many bird populations, especially in Southeast Asia.

[Finally, some good news on the avian influenza front although I hesitate to go that far. Sequencing showed the H5N1 virus in the Cambodia fatality was clade 2.3.2.1c which circulates endemically in Cambodia, as opposed to the 2.3.4.4b clade virus that is affecting many other areas globally. 29 contacts were also tested and found to be negative to include the victim's father who tested positive previously. This reinforces that the initial result was likely environmental contamination as opposed to true infection as I would expect the father to still be shedding live virus unless he was infected earlier than the original victim. Hopefully the Cambodian CDC can follow up with the close contacts to monitor for seroconversion as that would help complete the puzzle in terms of who was actually infected. The Cambodian CDC and their collaborators should be commended for its timely release of information as they've been a model for how to release information promptly while trying to answer key questions around the outbreak. - Mod.JH

Abstract
--------
In March 2022, a 61-year-old woman in France who had received a heart-lung transplant sought treatment with chronic hepatitis mainly characterized by increased liver enzymes. After ruling out common etiologies, we used metagenomic next-generation sequencing to analyze a liver biopsy sample and identified an unknown species of circovirus, tentatively named human circovirus 1 (HCirV-1). We found no other viral or bacterial sequences. HCirV-1 shared 70% amino acid identity with the closest known viral sequences. The viral genome was undetectable in blood samples from 2017-2019, then became detectable at low levels in September 2020 and peaked at very high titers (1010 genome copies/mL) in January 2022. In March 2022, we found >108 genome copies/g or mL in the liver and blood, concomitant with hepatic cytolysis. We detected HCirV-1 transcripts in 2% of hepatocytes, demonstrating viral replication and supporting the role of HCirV-1 in liver damage.

Case report
------------
A woman, 61 years of age, sought treatment in France with cytolytic hepatitis of unknown etiology. The patient had received a heart-lung transplant 17 years earlier because of Eisenmenger syndrome related to ventricular septal defect. Her maintenance immunosuppressive regimen included tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone. She had received pulse steroids 16 months before the hepatitis occurred to treat acute lung allograft dysfunction. The patient had had a localized left upper lobe pulmonary adenocarcinoma treated by surgery 2.5 years before this episode. She also had a history of chronic renal failure from calcineurin inhibitor (Cockcroft-Gault up to 23 mL/min), _Aspergillus_ spp. and _Scedosporium_ spp. bronchopulmonary infections, and parvovirus B19 and CoVID-19 infections. In November 2021, 14 months after receiving pulsed corticosteroid therapy, the patient was hospitalized for cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis with ganciclovir-resistant virus requiring treatment with foscavir, then maribavir, followed by letermovir for long-term maintenance therapy. At that time ultrasound examination detected cytolysis without symptoms or liver abnormalities (Figure 1 [for figures or tables, see original URL - Mod.LL]).

Four months after that hospitalization, hepatitis worsened; transaminase serum levels increased to up to 40 times the normal upper limit (Figure 1), leading to hospital readmission. The patient was asymptomatic except for recent weight loss but without biological severity because the prothrombin time level was normal. We ruled out common infections, including hepatitis A, B, C, and E, as well as HIV, CMV, herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus (VZV), human herpes virus 6 (HHV6), adenovirus, enterovirus in blood and feces, parvovirus B19, toxoplasmosis, syphilis, and leptospirosis. Only Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) PCR was positive (104.4 genome copies/mL of blood). There was no evidence for a timeline relationship between levels of liver enzymes and use of various medications by the patient. She reported no use of paracetamol (acetaminophen), alcohol, illicit drugs, or phytotherapy (use of herbal/plant supplements). A cardiac ultrasound did not show cardiac failure. We found no cardiac arrhythmia or vascular or biliary abnormalities from liver ultrasound and Doppler examinations, computerized tomography scan, or biliary magnetic resonance imaging results. Test results for autoimmune abnormalities were negative. Finally, aceruleoplasminemia test results were normal.

Pathological examination of a liver biopsy showed lobular hepatitis, slightly inflammatory, without epithelioid granuloma, substantial portal inflammation and fibrosis, or lymphoproliferation (Figure 2). Results of Ziehl, EBV, CMV, and adenovirus stains and bacteriological examinations of the biopsy sample, including mycobacterial cultures and PCR, broad-range 16S ribosomal RNA gene PCR, were negative. Herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, CMV, adenovirus, and enterovirus PCR results were negative; EBV PCR was positive (135 genome copies/microg DNA, cycle threshold = 35) but not ascribed to acute hepatitis. Overall, the lymphocytic pattern of inflammation in contrast to the lack of eosinophil infiltration, vascular or biliary injuries, and autoimmune liver disease (no plasmocytes) strongly suggested viral hepatitis. We considered the extent of both centrilobular necrosis and resorption by macrophages, which suggested recent liver cytolysis. After these first-line negative results from the liver biopsy, we conducted metagenomic NGS (mNGS), which revealed presenceu of the novel circovirus, HCirV-1. We further explored and quantified HCirV-1 using quantitative PCR (qPCR) on liver tissue, historical blood samples, feces, bronchoalveolar lavage, urine, and saliva samples from the patient (Table).

In November 2022, the patient's clinical condition was stable, and we noted complete recovery from cytolysis. In the context of her recent infectious diseases, we minimized the patient's immunosuppressive treatment, discontinuing mycophenolate mofetil (Figure 1). When we tried to ascertain possible sources of her HCirV-1 infection, the patient reported contact with 2 cats, both of which had contact with birds and rodents. HCirV-1 PCR was negative in the feces of the cats 2 months after her diagnosis. The patient reported no international travel. She did report receiving a blood transfusion 17 months before HCirV-1 was first detected (Figure 1).

Discussion
-----------
Our findings show a temporal association between hepatitis and a high load of a novel virus, HCirV-1, in the liver and blood of a 61-year-old female heart-lung transplant recipient. The patient received standard immunosuppressive therapy of tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and corticosteroids, but CMV colitis developed a year after pulsed corticosteroid therapy, suggesting a contemporary drug-induced high level of immunosuppression. Our results should be evaluated with Hill's criteria for causality (16).

We demonstrated the specificity of association using agnostic mNGS in the liver biopsy sample, showing absence of any additional virus except PCR-detected EBV. Given the low concentration of EBV in the liver biopsy, the concomitant higher replication in the blood (104.4 genome copies/mL), and the negative result from staining on liver biopsy, we did not consider EBV to be responsible for the cytolysis. In total, we did not detect HCirV-1 in 113 control participants: 40 tested by qPCR without hepatitis, 16 with hepatitis of known (50%) or unknown (50%) etiology (Appendix Table 1), and 57 mNGS-tested case-patients with hepatitis of unknown etiology (unpub. data, Appendix Table 2).

Circoviruses are DNA viruses. Of note, transcripts were detected in the nucleus of 2% of liver cells by HCirV-1-specific ISH, therefore consistent with viral expression and probably with virus replication. Given the lytic cycle of circoviruses, the results strongly support the role of HCirV-1 as the causative agent of hepatitis by targeting and lysing hepatocytes and also likely as a trigger of immune cytotoxic responses.

Animal circoviruses, such as porcine circoviruses (PCV) 1-4, have been responsible for reproductive failure, dermatitis, nephropathy, and respiratory diseases in animals (17,18), manifestations not found in the case we report. However, PCV2 associated with cases of jaundice in pigs (19-21) and hepatitis in a horse have been demonstrated (22). After PCV3 is inoculated into piglets, viremia progressively increases up to 108.9 copies/mL, reflective of findings in our study, but generally peaks around 21 days after infection, contrary to the more delayed peak we identified. Pathological lesions and PCV3 antigens have been detected in the liver, including white-gray nodules and necrosis with PCV3 antigen detected in liver lobular stroma, the hepatic sinus antral wall, and the cytoplasm in the sinus (23) and in other organs (lung, heart, kidney, lymph nodes, spleen, and small intestine) (24). PCV3 viremia could still be observed 140 days after infection (25), which is indicative of the ability of circoviruses to sustain long-term infection, as described in our patient. PCV3 was also able to infect nonhuman primate recipients of porcine cardiac xenografts (26,27).

Supporting the plausibility of HCirV-1 as disease agent, we found no temporal link for drug etiology or pathological evidence as alternative explanations. We ruled out common hepatitis virus infections, including hepatitis E virus. EBV test results were positive, but we ruled out a pathogenic role because EBV viral load remained stable around 104 genome copies/mL (Figure 1) and Epstein-Barr encoding region (EBER) staining was negative.

We first detected HCirV-1 before the liver pathology testing. Viral loads peaked 3 times, before the first and second cytolysis peaks and a third time concurrently with cytolysis peak (Figure 1). The high viral load of HCirV-1 (1010 genome copies/mL) also favors interpretation of its causative role in hepatitis. Indeed, a strong relationship between high virus load and disease severity has been described for hepatitis A (23) and B (28) viruses and adenovirus in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients (29), further illustrating that viral load often influences organ pathology (30).

As of November 2022, we had not identified the source of infection for this patient; specifically, we were unable to determine whether it was because of spillover of an animal virus or if it might be a previously unknown human virus. Although phylogenetic analysis placed this virus closest to known viruses hosted by a wild exotic animal that was not a possible source for our patient, we speculate that that HCirV-1 could be of animal origin, possibly from a dietary source in a similar manner as hepatitis E virus. Developing a specific antibody test will be instrumental in deciphering the ecology of the virus and better understanding its mechanisms of transmission. HCirV-1 was shed in saliva, urine, and feces (Table); whether the virus can possibly be transmitted between persons remains to be investigated.

In conclusion, detection of HCirV-1 expression in liver cells by ISH, the exclusion of other hepatitis etiologies, and the temporal association of severe cytolysis with very high HCirV-1 loads in the liver and blood strongly suggest a causal link. Furthermore, our experience using mNGS in immunocompromised patients, including transplant recipients, as well as the specific qPCR we performed on a representative cohort of these patients prove that, unlike TTV, HCirV-1 is not part of the commensal viral flora. Agnostic NGS was key to elucidate the etiology of this hepatitis case. HCirV-1 could now be tested for in hepatitis cases of unknown origin in solid organ transplant recipients.

After ruling out common etiologies, we used metagenomic next-generation sequencing to analyze a liver biopsy sample and identified an unknown species of circovirus, tentatively named human circovirus 1 (HCirV-1). We found no other viral or bacterial sequences. HCirV-1 shared 70% amino acid identity with the closest known viral sequences. The viral genome was undetectable in blood samples from 2017-2019, then became detectable at low levels in September 2020 and peaked at very high titers (1010 genome copies/mL) in January 2022. In March 2022, we found >108 genome copies/g or mL in the liver and blood, concomitant with hepatic cytolysis. We detected HCirV-1 transcripts in 2% of hepatocytes, demonstrating viral replication and supporting the role of HCirV-1 in liver damage.Case report------------A woman, 61 years of age, sought treatment in France with cytolytic hepatitis of unknown etiology. The patient had received a heart-lung transplant 17 years earlier because of Eisenmenger syndrome related to ventricular septal defect. Her maintenance immunosuppressive regimen included tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone. She had received pulse steroids 16 months before the hepatitis occurred to treat acute lung allograft dysfunction. The patient had had a localized left upper lobe pulmonary adenocarcinoma treated by surgery 2.5 years before this episode. She also had a history of chronic renal failure from calcineurin inhibitor (Cockcroft-Gault up to 23 mL/min), _Aspergillus_ spp. and _Scedosporium_ spp. bronchopulmonary infections, and parvovirus B19 and CoVID-19 infections. In November 2021, 14 months after receiving pulsed corticosteroid therapy, the patient was hospitalized for cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis with ganciclovir-resistant virus requiring treatment with foscavir, then maribavir, followed by letermovir for long-term maintenance therapy. At that time ultrasound examination detected cytolysis without symptoms or liver abnormalities (Figure 1 [for figures or tables, see original URL - Mod.LL]).Four months after that hospitalization, hepatitis worsened; transaminase serum levels increased to up to 40 times the normal upper limit (Figure 1), leading to hospital readmission. The patient was asymptomatic except for recent weight loss but without biological severity because the prothrombin time level was normal. We ruled out common infections, including hepatitis A, B, C, and E, as well as HIV, CMV, herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus (VZV), human herpes virus 6 (HHV6), adenovirus, enterovirus in blood and feces, parvovirus B19, toxoplasmosis, syphilis, and leptospirosis. Only Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) PCR was positive (104.4 genome copies/mL of blood). There was no evidence for a timeline relationship between levels of liver enzymes and use of various medications by the patient. She reported no use of paracetamol (acetaminophen), alcohol, illicit drugs, or phytotherapy (use of herbal/plant supplements). A cardiac ultrasound did not show cardiac failure. We found no cardiac arrhythmia or vascular or biliary abnormalities from liver ultrasound and Doppler examinations, computerized tomography scan, or biliary magnetic resonance imaging results. Test results for autoimmune abnormalities were negative. Finally, aceruleoplasminemia test results were normal.Pathological examination of a liver biopsy showed lobular hepatitis, slightly inflammatory, without epithelioid granuloma, substantial portal inflammation and fibrosis, or lymphoproliferation (Figure 2). Results of Ziehl, EBV, CMV, and adenovirus stains and bacteriological examinations of the biopsy sample, including mycobacterial cultures and PCR, broad-range 16S ribosomal RNA gene PCR, were negative. Herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, CMV, adenovirus, and enterovirus PCR results were negative; EBV PCR was positive (135 genome copies/microg DNA, cycle threshold = 35) but not ascribed to acute hepatitis. Overall, the lymphocytic pattern of inflammation in contrast to the lack of eosinophil infiltration, vascular or biliary injuries, and autoimmune liver disease (no plasmocytes) strongly suggested viral hepatitis. We considered the extent of both centrilobular necrosis and resorption by macrophages, which suggested recent liver cytolysis. After these first-line negative results from the liver biopsy, we conducted metagenomic NGS (mNGS), which revealed presenceu of the novel circovirus, HCirV-1. We further explored and quantified HCirV-1 using quantitative PCR (qPCR) on liver tissue, historical blood samples, feces, bronchoalveolar lavage, urine, and saliva samples from the patient (Table).In November 2022, the patient's clinical condition was stable, and we noted complete recovery from cytolysis. In the context of her recent infectious diseases, we minimized the patient's immunosuppressive treatment, discontinuing mycophenolate mofetil (Figure 1). When we tried to ascertain possible sources of her HCirV-1 infection, the patient reported contact with 2 cats, both of which had contact with birds and rodents. HCirV-1 PCR was negative in the feces of the cats 2 months after her diagnosis. The patient reported no international travel. She did report receiving a blood transfusion 17 months before HCirV-1 was first detected (Figure 1).Discussion-----------Our findings show a temporal association between hepatitis and a high load of a novel virus, HCirV-1, in the liver and blood of a 61-year-old female heart-lung transplant recipient. The patient received standard immunosuppressive therapy of tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and corticosteroids, but CMV colitis developed a year after pulsed corticosteroid therapy, suggesting a contemporary drug-induced high level of immunosuppression. Our results should be evaluated with Hill's criteria for causality (16).We demonstrated the specificity of association using agnostic mNGS in the liver biopsy sample, showing absence of any additional virus except PCR-detected EBV. Given the low concentration of EBV in the liver biopsy, the concomitant higher replication in the blood (104.4 genome copies/mL), and the negative result from staining on liver biopsy, we did not consider EBV to be responsible for the cytolysis. In total, we did not detect HCirV-1 in 113 control participants: 40 tested by qPCR without hepatitis, 16 with hepatitis of known (50%) or unknown (50%) etiology (Appendix Table 1), and 57 mNGS-tested case-patients with hepatitis of unknown etiology (unpub. data, Appendix Table 2).Circoviruses are DNA viruses. Of note, transcripts were detected in the nucleus of 2% of liver cells by HCirV-1-specific ISH, therefore consistent with viral expression and probably with virus replication. Given the lytic cycle of circoviruses, the results strongly support the role of HCirV-1 as the causative agent of hepatitis by targeting and lysing hepatocytes and also likely as a trigger of immune cytotoxic responses.Animal circoviruses, such as porcine circoviruses (PCV) 1-4, have been responsible for reproductive failure, dermatitis, nephropathy, and respiratory diseases in animals (17,18), manifestations not found in the case we report. However, PCV2 associated with cases of jaundice in pigs (19-21) and hepatitis in a horse have been demonstrated (22). After PCV3 is inoculated into piglets, viremia progressively increases up to 108.9 copies/mL, reflective of findings in our study, but generally peaks around 21 days after infection, contrary to the more delayed peak we identified. Pathological lesions and PCV3 antigens have been detected in the liver, including white-gray nodules and necrosis with PCV3 antigen detected in liver lobular stroma, the hepatic sinus antral wall, and the cytoplasm in the sinus (23) and in other organs (lung, heart, kidney, lymph nodes, spleen, and small intestine) (24). PCV3 viremia could still be observed 140 days after infection (25), which is indicative of the ability of circoviruses to sustain long-term infection, as described in our patient. PCV3 was also able to infect nonhuman primate recipients of porcine cardiac xenografts (26,27).Supporting the plausibility of HCirV-1 as disease agent, we found no temporal link for drug etiology or pathological evidence as alternative explanations. We ruled out common hepatitis virus infections, including hepatitis E virus. EBV test results were positive, but we ruled out a pathogenic role because EBV viral load remained stable around 104 genome copies/mL (Figure 1) and Epstein-Barr encoding region (EBER) staining was negative.We first detected HCirV-1 before the liver pathology testing. Viral loads peaked 3 times, before the first and second cytolysis peaks and a third time concurrently with cytolysis peak (Figure 1). The high viral load of HCirV-1 (1010 genome copies/mL) also favors interpretation of its causative role in hepatitis. Indeed, a strong relationship between high virus load and disease severity has been described for hepatitis A (23) and B (28) viruses and adenovirus in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients (29), further illustrating that viral load often influences organ pathology (30).As of November 2022, we had not identified the source of infection for this patient; specifically, we were unable to determine whether it was because of spillover of an animal virus or if it might be a previously unknown human virus. Although phylogenetic analysis placed this virus closest to known viruses hosted by a wild exotic animal that was not a possible source for our patient, we speculate that that HCirV-1 could be of animal origin, possibly from a dietary source in a similar manner as hepatitis E virus. Developing a specific antibody test will be instrumental in deciphering the ecology of the virus and better understanding its mechanisms of transmission. HCirV-1 was shed in saliva, urine, and feces (Table); whether the virus can possibly be transmitted between persons remains to be investigated.In conclusion, detection of HCirV-1 expression in liver cells by ISH, the exclusion of other hepatitis etiologies, and the temporal association of severe cytolysis with very high HCirV-1 loads in the liver and blood strongly suggest a causal link. Furthermore, our experience using mNGS in immunocompromised patients, including transplant recipients, as well as the specific qPCR we performed on a representative cohort of these patients prove that, unlike TTV, HCirV-1 is not part of the commensal viral flora. Agnostic NGS was key to elucidate the etiology of this hepatitis case. HCirV-1 could now be tested for in hepatitis cases of unknown origin in solid organ transplant recipients.--Communicated by:ProMED[This is the 1st report of a human circovirus liver infection.

The US National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases today [15 Feb 2023] reported that 5 additional children with acute hepatitis of unknown etiology were reported over the past month.

Investigators are examining a possible relationship to adenovirus type 41 infection, which is not a common cause of hepatitis in otherwise healthy children. ""While rare, children can still have serious hepatitis, and we don't always know the cause. That's why investigators continue to look at possible causes and investigate,"" wrote the CDC.

The US CDC is looking broadly, including hepatitis cases of unknown origin in children under 10 years of age. Since 1 Oct 2021, the number of persons under investigation (PUI) has reached 389 as of 15 Feb 2023. Among the reported PUIs, about 90% required hospitalization, a few needed a liver transplant, and over 10 died.

The WHO, the UK, Europe, and Canada have recently reported acute liver inflammation infections of unknown etiology among children.

Experts are warning that there has been an outbreak of foodborne illness cases in a Welsh town. Public Health Wales has confirmed that Abergavenny has seen a rise in cases of foodborne illness, believed to be caused by the _Shigella_ bacterium. _Shigella_ bacteria cause an infection called shigellosis, and symptoms can include diarrhea (which can sometimes include blood), fever, and stomach cramps. The symptoms can begin one to 2 days after being infected and can last up to 7 days. This infection is not usually life-threatening but can result in hospitalization in some cases.

A person told WalesOnline that their family and friends have been put through ""horrendous sickness"" as a result of contracting shigellosis. It is understood to be linked to a restaurant they visited. They explained: ""My relatives became incredibly sick on the following Sunday and Monday [2-3 days later] with symptoms persisting through to the mid-week for one and late week for the other. Symptoms included some vomiting, fevers, terrible stomach cramps, and blood in their diarrhea.""

A Public Health Wales spokesperson said: ""Public Health Wales is aware of an increase in cases of gastrointestinal illness in the Abergavenny area, which may be due to _Shigella_ infection. All appropriate public health actions needed are being taken with the required urgency.

Public Health Wales said it is currently unable to provide the number of confirmed cases.

The Environment Services of the City of Helsinki is investigating a number of suspected cases of foodborne illness that are believed to be related to dining at several different restaurants and a pop-up event since the beginning of February [2023]. Currently, there are about 20 known cases of illness. The individuals who have fallen ill all consumed oysters, and environmental services have taken food samples from the restaurants as well as patient samples from the city's epidemiological action. Norovirus has been found in the samples.

The food safety unit is requesting that anyone who has eaten oysters at Fisken på Disken, Ravintola Natura, Ravintola Gillet, The Cock, Ravintola Meripaviljonki, and the pop-up event at Ravintola Sake bar & Izakaya in February 2023 and has fallen ill after their meal, to contact the food safety unit. Illnesses may also be linked to other restaurants. Those who have fallen ill are encouraged to contact the food safety unit primarily through an electronic food poisoning form at <https://ilppa.fi>.

Norovirus is the most common cause of sudden intestinal infections in Finland. Oysters have previously been found to transmit norovirus infections. Oysters that are consumed raw or undercooked are common sources of transmission for epidemics because they filter noroviruses while living in water contaminated with human feces. Norovirus is destroyed when food is heated to +90 deg C [194 deg F] for 2 minutes.

Norovirus is easily transmitted from person to person either directly or indirectly, for example, through contaminated surfaces. Norovirus can also spread easily through contaminated food or water. A very small amount of the virus is enough to cause infection. The incubation period for norovirus is usually 12-48 hours. Typical symptoms include diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, and often fever, abdominal pain, and cramps. Symptoms often start very suddenly and usually last for about 12-72 hours.

Some restaurants have already been inspected following the outbreak of food poisoning, and oyster importers have taken steps to recall their products. Environmental Services is investigating the epidemic in collaboration with the City of Helsinki's epidemiological action.

[Norovirus appears to be the cause of this outbreak.

The following are myths about oysters (adapted from <https://www.fda.gov/food/health-educators/raw-oyster-myths>).

""Myth: Eating raw oysters is safe if you drown them in hot sauce, which kills everything.
Fact: The active ingredients in hot sauce have no more effect on harmful bacteria than plain water. Nothing but prolonged exposure to heat at a high enough temperature will kill bacteria.

""Myth: Avoid oysters from polluted waters and you'll be fine.
Fact: Many pathogens in oysters have nothing to do with pollution. Some harmful bacteria thrive naturally in warm coastal areas (such as the Gulf of Mexico) where oysters live.

""Myth: An experienced oyster lover can tell a good oyster from a bad one.
Fact: [These pathogens] can't be seen, smelled, or even tasted. Don't rely on your senses to decide if an oyster is safe.

""Myth: Alcohol kills harmful [organisms].
Fact: Alcohol may impair your good judgment, but it doesn't destroy harmful bacteria.""

Myth: Eating oysters in months with an ""R"" in their name is safe.
Fact: Even though cold-weather-harvested oysters are likely somewhat safer, many oysters come from warmer climates and are imported into the colder climate.

Myth: Raw oysters are an aphrodisiac and will cure a hangover.
Fact: There is no scientific evidence that either of these commonly held beliefs is true.

Another potential etiology not often discussed is diarrheal shellfish poisoning (DSP). DSP ""is a gastrointestinal illness caused by the consumption of shellfish contaminated with algal toxins produced by marine dinoflagellates belonging to the genera _Dinophysis_ spp. (_D. fortii_, _D. mitra_, _D. rotundata_, _D. tripos_, _D. acuta_, _D. norvegica_, and _D. acuminata_) and _Prorocentrum_ spp. (_P. lima_, _P. maculosum_, _P. concavum_, and _P. hoffmannianum_). The DSP toxins, including okadaic acid (OA) and its analogues dinophysistoxin-1 (DTX-1), dinophysistoxin-2 (DTX-2), and dinophysistoxin-3 (DTX-3), belong to the larger group of lipophilic toxins, which also includes the azaspiracid, yessotoxin, and pectenotoxin group toxins.""
(<https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/ese.16.46.20020-en>)

The term ""diarrhetic shellfish poisoning"" is often used for the illness, but this moderator prefers to use ""diarrheal shellfish poisoning"" to avoid any confusion between the almost homophones of ""diarrhetic"" and ""diuretic.""

DSP is often mistaken for norovirus-like disease. It is treated with rehydration, and affected individuals usually recover in 1 to 2 days. DSP diarrhea is the most commonly reported symptom (92%), closely followed by nausea (80%) and vomiting (79%), with onset 30 minutes to 12 hours from ingestion. Cooking or freezing does not destroy the toxin. DSP is most commonly found in shellfish in Europe and Japan but can appear anywhere and bears consideration with the appropriate epidemiology. - Mod.LL

Currently, there are about 20 known cases of illness. The individuals who have fallen ill all consumed oysters, and environmental services have taken food samples from the restaurants as well as patient samples from the city's epidemiological action. Norovirus has been found in the samples.The food safety unit is requesting that anyone who has eaten oysters at Fisken på Disken, Ravintola Natura, Ravintola Gillet, The Cock, Ravintola Meripaviljonki, and the pop-up event at Ravintola Sake bar & Izakaya in February 2023 and has fallen ill after their meal, to contact the food safety unit. Illnesses may also be linked to other restaurants. Those who have fallen ill are encouraged to contact the food safety unit primarily through an electronic food poisoning form at <https://ilppa.fi>.Norovirus is the most common cause of sudden intestinal infections in Finland. Oysters have previously been found to transmit norovirus infections.

Summary
-------
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been monitoring an increase in extensively drug-resistant (XDR) _Shigella_ infections (shigellosis) reported through national surveillance systems [1]. In 2022, about 5% of _Shigella_ infections reported to CDC were caused by XDR strains, compared with 0% in 2015. Clinicians treating patients infected with XDR strains have limited antimicrobial treatment options. _Shigella_ bacteria are easily transmissible. XDR _Shigella_ strains can spread antimicrobial resistance genes to other enteric bacteria. Given these potentially serious public health concerns, CDC asks healthcare professionals to be vigilant about suspecting and reporting cases of XDR _Shigella_ infection to their local or state health department and educating patients and communities at increased risk about prevention and transmission.

Shigellosis is an acute enteric infection that is an important cause of domestically acquired and travel-associated bacterial diarrhea in the United States. Shigellosis usually causes inflammatory diarrhea that can be bloody and may also lead to fever, abdominal cramping, and tenesmus (urge to defecate, even though bowels are empty). Infections are generally self-limiting; however, antimicrobial treatment may be indicated to prevent complications or shorten the duration of illness [2]. CDC defines XDR _Shigella_ bacteria as strains that are resistant to all commonly recommended empiric and alternative antibiotics -- azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), and ampicillin. Currently, there are no data from clinical studies of treatment of XDR _Shigella_ to inform recommendations for the optimal antimicrobial treatment of these infections. As such, CDC does not have recommendations for optimal antimicrobial treatment of XDR _Shigella_ infections.

Background
----------
_Shigella_ bacteria are transmitted by the fecal-oral route, directly through person-to-person contact including sexual contact, and indirectly through contaminated food, water, and other routes. _Shigella_ bacteria are easily transmitted because of the low infectious dose (as few as 10-100 organisms), and outbreaks tend to occur among people in close-contact settings [2-6].

Historically, shigellosis has predominantly affected young children (age 1-4 years) in the United States. More recently, CDC has observed an increase in antimicrobial-resistant _Shigella_ infections among adult populations [4,5] especially
- Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM)
- People experiencing homelessness
- International travelers
- People living with HIV

Most people with diarrheal illness require only supportive care and fluid replacement. 

Antimicrobial agents are not always needed for mild shigellosis, but they may be indicated to
- Shorten the duration of illness (by about 2 days), or
- Reduce the likelihood of transmission, for example, during outbreaks, in institutional settings, from food handlers to immunocompromised persons or those being treated with immunosuppressive drugs, and to people living with HIV.

In the United States, recommended empiric antimicrobial agents include azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, or ceftriaxone. Ampicillin or TMP-SMX are recommended as alternative treatments for susceptible strains [2].

In the United States, the percentage of _Shigella_ infections caused by XDR strains reported to CDC increased from zero in 2015 to 5% in 2022 (Figure). Between 1 Jan 2015 and 22 Jan 2023, CDC received reports of 239 XDR _Shigella_ isolates, with _S. sonnei_ accounting for the largest percentage (66%) followed by _S. flexneri_ (34%). The median age of patients was 42 years (range 1-83 years). Among 232 patients with available information, 82% were men, 13% were women, and 5% were children. Among 41 patients who answered questions about recent sexual activity, 88% reported male-to-male sexual contact.

CDC will continue to monitor XDR _Shigella_ infections and track _Shigella_ isolates with unique or worrisome antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and genetic resistance markers. In addition, CDC is conducting an analysis of antimicrobial-resistant _Shigella_ infections in the United States using data in the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System for Enteric Bacteria (NARMS).

Recommendations for healthcare professionals
--------------------------------------------
Diagnosis
Consider shigellosis in the differential diagnosis of acute diarrhea, especially for patients at higher risk for _Shigella_ infection, including young children; MSM; people experiencing homelessness; international travelers; immunocompromised persons; and people living with HIV.

If shigellosis is suspected, ask the patient about relevant exposures and social history, including sexual activity, housing status, and international travel. When ordering diagnostic testing for _Shigella_, stool culture is preferred for patients who will require antimicrobial treatment. If a culture-independent diagnostic test (CIDT) is performed instead of culture and _Shigella_ bacteria are detected, request on sample submission that the clinical laboratory perform reflex culture. If a culture is positive for _Shigella_, order antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) to inform antimicrobial selection.
 
Clinical management
Most patients recover from shigellosis without antimicrobial treatment. Oral rehydration may be sufficient for many people with shigellosis. Use AST results to guide antimicrobial treatment selection, when possible. Encourage patients to inform you if symptoms do not improve within 48 hours after beginning antibiotics.

To date, there are no CDC recommendations for treating XDR shigellosis in the United States; however, a recent publication from the United Kingdom outlined a possible strategy for treating severe XDR shigellosis using oral pivmecillinam and fosfomycin (for patients with prolonged symptoms or as oral step-down after intravenous treatment) or IV carbapenems and colistin (for hospitalized patients with severe infections or complications) [7]. 

XDR _Shigella_ isolates in the United States typically do not carry resistance mechanisms for fosfomycin or carbapenems. Note: Pivmecillinam is not commercially available for use in the United States.

Healthcare providers treating XDR shigellosis should consult with a specialist knowledgeable in treating antibiotic-resistant bacteria to determine the best treatment options. Be aware that overusing antibiotics can contribute to the development of antimicrobial resistance. CDC recommends using antibiotics only when clinically indicated.
 
Considerations for sexual health
Increases in drug-resistant _Shigella_ infections have been described among adult men and may be associated with transmission among MSM. Cases of shigellosis co-occurring with other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV, have been described among MSM [8].

Take a sexual history if shigellosis is suspected. People with acute proctitis and concern for sexually transmitted proctocolitis or enteritis should be tested for other STIs, including HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia at exposed sites [9]. Clinicians should encourage all persons with STIs to notify their sex partners and urge them to seek medical evaluation and treatment. Exceptions to this practice include circumstances posing a risk for intimate partner violence [9].
 
Reporting
Shigellosis is a nationally notifiable disease. Healthcare professionals and clinical laboratories should report all cases to their local or state health department. Healthcare professionals should consult their local or state health department for guidance on when patients may return to childcare, school, or work.
 
Counseling patients
Please counsel patients with suspected or confirmed shigellosis about measures they can take to keep others healthy. Patients taking antibiotics should continue to follow prevention measures. All patients with suspected or confirmed shigellosis should:
- Stay home from school or from healthcare, food service, or childcare jobs while sick or until the health department says it's safe to return.
- During diarrhea and for 2 weeks after it ends: abstain from sex (anal, oral, penile, or vaginal); wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, including at key times such as after using the toilet, before and after changing diapers, cleaning up after someone who is sick, and before preparing or eating food; do not prepare food for others, if possible; stay out of recreational water, including swimming pools, hot tubs, water playgrounds, oceans, lakes, and rivers.
- Closely follow safer sex practices for at least 2 weeks after resuming sex to prevent the spread of _Shigella_ bacteria that may remain in stool.
- Wash hands, genitals, and anus with soap and water before and after sexual activity.
- Wash hands after touching sex toys, external and internal condoms, dental dams, and any other items that might have been in contact with the vagina or anus.
- Use condoms or dental dams during oral-genital sex and oral-anal sex.
- Use latex gloves during anal fingering or fisting.
- Wash sex toys with soap and water after each use.

Recommendations for laboratories
--------------------------------
Clinical laboratories should submit known or suspected XDR _Shigella_ isolates to the local or state public health laboratory. State laboratories should perform whole genome sequencing whenever possible. For questions or concerns, contact CDC at <EntericBacteria@cdc.gov>.

Recommendations for public health officials
-------------------------------------------
Be aware that:
- _Shigella_ transmission is difficult to control because the bacteria spread easily and rapidly between people, including through sexual activity.
- Drug-resistant _Shigella_ infections have been reported with increasing frequency, particularly among people experiencing homelessness, international travelers, immunocompromised people, and MSM.

To help CDC gather data to improve outcomes, report information about treatment response and clinical outcomes of XDR _Shigella_ infections to <EntericBacteria@cdc.gov>. Consider working with your infection prevention and control network and other partners to educate providers and people at high risk for XDR _Shigella_ infections.

Recommendations for the public
------------------------------
_Shigella_ bacteria can spread easily from one person to another -- and it only takes a small amount of _Shigella_ to make someone sick. Learn how you can help protect yourself and your loved ones from getting sick.

[Humans are the only reservoir for _Shigella_, which are easily transmitted from person to person because _Shigella_ are relatively resistant to gastric acidity, and only a few (10-100) organisms, if swallowed, need to survive passage through the stomach and are sufficient to establish infection in the lower intestinal tract.

The organisms are spread via hands, mouth, food, or water that has come into contact with the stool of a person infected with _Shigella_. Although shigellosis is usually self-limited in 5-7 days without antibiotic treatment, antibiotics are commonly used to decrease fecal excretion of the organism that may otherwise last up to several weeks and for severe cases that have prolonged dysentery or sepsis. However, resistance to antimicrobials, such as fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin), 3rd generation cephalosporins (e.g., ceftriaxone) and macrolides (e.g., azithromycin), has restricted treatment options.

Of the 4 _Shigella_ species (_S. sonnei_, _S. flexneri_, _S. boydii_, and _S. dysenteriae_), _S. sonnei_ is the most common species in the USA and Europe. In 2015, ProMED posted a report of an outbreak of multidrug-resistant (MDR) _S. sonnei_ in the USA, affecting more than 300 people, that appeared to have been repeatedly imported by international travel in men who have sex with men (MSM) (ProMED post Shigellosis - USA (03): travel, MSM, antimicrobial resistance 20151021.3732921). In 2016, ProMED posted a report of a single clone, based on whole genome sequencing (WGS), widespread in South Asia, that was likely driving an intercontinental surge of ciprofloxacin-resistant _S. sonnei_ cases (ProMED post Shigellosis, antimicrobial-resistant - South Asia: spread 20160904.4464085). Then, in 2019, ProMED reported an outbreak between March and November 2018 in the UK of 17 cases of shigellosis caused by an MDR _Shigella_ clone, based on WGS, that clustered among MSM; 9 further cases were identified in the USA (ProMED post Shigellosis - UK: multiresistant, MSM 20190128.6279377 and <https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/769163/SHGLL-SONN_2018275.pdf>).

Resistance markers in this clone included blaCTX-M-27, which encodes an extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL), a single gyrA mutation associated with reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones and the macrolide resistance markers erm(B) and mph(A). Consequently, treatment of infections caused by this MDR strain with fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin), azithromycin, and ceftriaxone is unlikely to be effective. TMP/SMX had been one of the drugs of choice for the treatment of shigellosis, but emerging resistance to this antimicrobial drug has limited its empiric use (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3462054/>)

_S. sonnei_ isolates simultaneously resistant to ciprofloxacin, 3rd generation cephalosporins, and azithromycin, described as ""extensively drug-resistant"" (XDR), were first found in France in 2015; by 2021, 22.3% and in 2022, 21.7% were XDR _S. sonnei_ (<https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36222-8>). All but one of these XDR isolates were also resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and 87.2% (143/164) were resistant to tetracyclines. All these isolates remained susceptible to carbapenems. Genotyping and the male-to-female case ratio (117 male and 4 female patients) of the XDR isolates suggested that the majority of XDR cases, other than the 31 cases in an elementary school setting, may have been associated with international MSM networks. - Mod.ML

Encourage patients to inform you if symptoms do not improve within 48 hours after beginning antibiotics.To date, there are no CDC recommendations for treating XDR shigellosis in the United States; however, a recent publication from the United Kingdom outlined a possible strategy for treating severe XDR shigellosis using oral pivmecillinam and fosfomycin (for patients with prolonged symptoms or as oral step-down after intravenous treatment) or IV carbapenems and colistin (for hospitalized patients with severe infections or complications) [7]. XDR _Shigella_ isolates in the United States typically do not carry resistance mechanisms for fosfomycin or carbapenems. Note: Pivmecillinam is not commercially available for use in the United States.Healthcare providers treating XDR shigellosis should consult with a specialist knowledgeable in treating antibiotic-resistant bacteria to determine the best treatment options. Be aware that overusing antibiotics can contribute to the development of antimicrobial resistance. CDC recommends using antibiotics only when clinically indicated. Considerations for sexual healthIncreases in drug-resistant _Shigella_ infections have been described among adult men and may be associated with transmission among MSM. Cases of shigellosis co-occurring with other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV, have been described among MSM [8].Take a sexual history if shigellosis is suspected. People with acute proctitis and concern for sexually transmitted proctocolitis or enteritis should be tested for other STIs, including HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia at exposed sites [9]. Clinicians should encourage all persons with STIs to notify their sex partners and urge them to seek medical evaluation and treatment. Exceptions to this practice include circumstances posing a risk for intimate partner violence [9]. ReportingShigellosis is a nationally notifiable disease. Healthcare professionals and clinical laboratories should report all cases to their local or state health department. Healthcare professionals should consult their local or state health department for guidance on when patients may return to childcare, school, or work. Counseling patientsPlease counsel patients with suspected or confirmed shigellosis about measures they can take to keep others healthy. Patients taking antibiotics should continue to follow prevention measures. All patients with suspected or confirmed shigellosis should:- Stay home from school or from healthcare, food service, or childcare jobs while sick or until the health department says it's safe to return.- During diarrhea and for 2 weeks after it ends: abstain from sex (anal, oral, penile, or vaginal); wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, including at key times such as after using the toilet, before and after changing diapers, cleaning up after someone who is sick, and before preparing or eating food; do not prepare food for others, if possible; stay out of recreational water, including swimming pools, hot tubs, water playgrounds, oceans, lakes, and rivers.- Closely follow safer sex practices for at least 2 weeks after resuming sex to prevent the spread of _Shigella_ bacteria that may remain in stool.- Wash hands, genitals, and anus with soap and water before and after sexual activity.- Wash hands after touching sex toys, external and internal condoms, dental dams, and any other items that might have been in contact with the vagina or anus.- Use condoms or dental dams during oral-genital sex and oral-anal sex.- Use latex gloves during anal fingering or fisting.- Wash sex toys with soap and water after each use.Recommendations for laboratories--------------------------------Clinical laboratories should submit known or suspected XDR _Shigella_ isolates to the local or state public health laboratory. State laboratories should perform whole genome sequencing whenever possible. For questions or concerns, contact CDC at <EntericBacteria@cdc.gov>.Recommendations for public health officials-------------------------------------------Be aware that:- _Shigella_ transmission is difficult to control because the bacteria spread easily and rapidly between people, including through sexual activity.- Drug-resistant _Shigella_ infections have been reported with increasing frequency, particularly among people experiencing homelessness, international travelers, immunocompromised people, and MSM.To help CDC gather data to improve outcomes, report information about treatment response and clinical outcomes of XDR _Shigella_ infections to <EntericBacteria@cdc.gov>. Consider working with your infection prevention and control network and other partners to educate providers and people at high risk for XDR _Shigella_ infections.Recommendations for the public------------------------------_Shigella_ bacteria can spread easily from one person to another -- and it only takes a small amount of _Shigella_ to make someone sick. Learn how you can help protect yourself and your loved ones from getting sick.[Figure and references are available at the source URL. - Mod.ML]--Communicated by:ProMED[Humans are the only reservoir for _Shigella_, which are easily transmitted from person to person because _Shigella_ are relatively resistant to gastric acidity, and only a few (10-100) organisms, if swallowed, need to survive passage through the stomach and are sufficient to establish infection in the lower intestinal tract.The organisms are spread via hands, mouth, food, or water that has come into contact with the stool of a person infected with _Shigella_. Although shigellosis is usually self-limited in 5-7 days without antibiotic treatment, antibiotics are commonly used to decrease fecal excretion of the organism that may otherwise last up to several weeks and for severe cases that have prolonged dysentery or sepsis. However, resistance to antimicrobials, such as fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin), 3rd generation cephalosporins (e.g., ceftriaxone) and macrolides (e.g., azithromycin), has restricted treatment options.Of the 4 _Shigella_ species (_S. sonnei_, _S. flexneri_, _S. boydii_, and _S. dysenteriae_), _S. sonnei_ is the most common species in the USA and Europe. In 2015, ProMED posted a report of an outbreak of multidrug-resistant (MDR) _S. sonnei_ in the USA, affecting more than 300 people, that appeared to have been repeatedly imported by international travel in men who have sex with men (MSM) (ProMED post Shigellosis - USA (03): travel, MSM, antimicrobial resistance 20151021.3732921). In 2016, ProMED posted a report of a single clone, based on whole genome sequencing (WGS), widespread in South Asia, that was likely driving an intercontinental surge of ciprofloxacin-resistant _S. sonnei_ cases (ProMED post Shigellosis, antimicrobial-resistant - South Asia: spread 20160904.4464085). Then, in 2019, ProMED reported an outbreak between March and November 2018 in the UK of 17 cases of shigellosis caused by an MDR _Shigella_ clone, based on WGS, that clustered among MSM; 9 further cases were identified in the USA (ProMED post Shigellosis - UK: multiresistant, MSM 20190128.6279377 and <https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/769163/SHGLL-SONN_2018275.pdf>).Resistance markers in this clone included blaCTX-M-27, which encodes an extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL), a single gyrA mutation associated with reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones and the macrolide resistance markers erm(B) and mph(A). Consequently, treatment of infections caused by this MDR strain with fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin), azithromycin, and ceftriaxone is unlikely to be effective. TMP/SMX had been one of the drugs of choice for the treatment of shigellosis, but emerging resistance to this antimicrobial drug has limited its empiric use (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3462054/>)_S. sonnei_ isolates simultaneously resistant to ciprofloxacin, 3rd generation cephalosporins, and azithromycin, described as ""extensively drug-resistant"" (XDR), were first found in France in 2015; by 2021, 22.3% and in 2022, 21.7% were XDR _S. sonnei_ (<https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36222-8>). All but one of these XDR isolates were also resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and 87.2% (143/164) were resistant to tetracyclines. All these isolates remained susceptible to carbapenems. Genotyping and the male-to-female case ratio (117 male and 4 female patients) of the XDR isolates suggested that the majority of XDR cases, other than the 31 cases in an elementary school setting, may have been associated with international MSM networks. - Mod.MLProMED map:United States: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8708603,106>]",CDC Health Alert Network (HAN),,

The confirmation of new cases of bluetongue disease in farms in the provinces of Zamora, Ourense and Pontevedra has extended the declaration of areas affected by the disease to the borders of the province of Zamora and the Autonomous Community of Galicia.

Throughout this month [February 2023], the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has confirmed 9 new cases of this viral, reportable disease in Andalusia, Galicia and Castilla y León, in addition to the 2 detected at the end of January [2023] in the province of Salamanca, according to data collected by EFE.

The new outbreaks of this ruminant disease that does not affect humans, expands the map of affected areas, which have spread from Andalusia to Extremadura, western Castilla y León, Salamanca, Ávila and southern Madrid and now also through the western part of the province of Zamora, the provinces of Ourense and Pontevedra and the south of Lugo [see map at <https://www.nationsonline.org/maps/Spain-Administrative-Map.jpg>].

Prevention, surveillance and control measures have been immediately reinforced in the affected territories; mandatory vaccination against BT serotype 4 will be introduced in Zamora, Ourense and Pontevedra.

Vaccination will involve all animals over 3 months old, both sheep and cattle, in the new areas. Passive surveillance will also be strengthened, with the obligation to report any suspicion and to disinfect the farms, according to the Ministry.

In the province of Zamora, a new outbreak of the disease was detected on a farm in the town of Fariza and was confirmed by the reference laboratory in Algete (Madrid) on 2 Feb 2023.

Added to this case is another subsequent outbreak confirmed in Ciudad Rodrigo (Salamanca) on 17 Feb 2023 and the 2 reported on 25 and 26 Jan 2023 in the Salamanca towns of Ciudad Rodrigo and El Cerro, respectively.

In the Community of Galicia, outbreaks in Ourense were located in Sarreaus and Castro Caldelas, confirmed on 15 Feb 2023. Another case was also confirmed on 15 Feb 2023 in Fornelos de Montes (Pontevedra), followed 2 days later [17 Feb 2023] by another one in the Pontevedra municipality of As Neves.

This month [February 2023], new cases of BT-4 [see comment] have also been detected in Carmona (Seville), Cártama (Málaga) and Jimena de la Frontera (Cádiz).

[Most likely, these cases are 'newly detected', not acute/new events. The infection of the positive cattle had likely taken place during the last vector season, which terminated in late 2022. 

The detection of positive BTV-4 cattle in the autonomous community of Galicia (provinces of Pontevedra and Ourense) was reported in ProMED post 20230219.8708478. According to the current report, resulting from EU-prescribed active surveillance, BTV-4 is present in an additional province, Zamora, of the autonomous community of Castilla y León. BTV-4 has not been found in this region since 2009. 

Spain is one of the EC member states in which certain zones have obtained 'bluetongue-free' status, allowing movements of the relevant animals (cattle, sheep, goats) to and from free zones in other member states. The southern parts of Spain have experienced clinical BTV-4 during the recent vector season, starting late June 2022. The affected territories, as of 25 Jan 2023, are presented on EU's bluetongue map, which shows the situation in all member states. The map, last updated on 26 Jan 2023, is available at <https://food.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2023-01/ad_control-measures_bt_restrictedzones-map.pdf>. The next version of the map is expected to show the increased BTV-4 infected territory of Spain, in provinces bordering north Portugal. Portugal has the status of a BTV-4 infected country. 

BTV-4 is one of 27 known serotypes of BTV. Most serotypes cause clinical disease, and -- in susceptible sheep breeds -- mortality. Cattle are readily infected by the BTV vector (_Culicoides_ species) and undergo viraemia, but in most cases, with the exception of BTV-8 infection, subclinically or with mild clinical signs. - Mod.AS

Fort Good Hope dog tests positive for rabies
--------------------------------------------
A Fort Good Hope dog having had contact with a wild fox has tested positive for rabies, the NWT chief environmental health officer says.

Rabies among pets or animals almost invariably triggers a warning in Northwest Territories communities as rabies is nearly always fatal in humans without urgent treatment.

""Residents of Fort Good Hope should contact the Cassien Edgi Health Centre and report any bites or scratches or contact any wild animals or dogs immediately,"" Friday's [24 Feb 2023] warning stated.

""The health staff will assess your exposure and ensure proper follow-up can be completed.""

More information about rabies, including signs in animals like dogs, is available from the Department of Health and Social Services. Don't touch any animal you think may have rabies, and instead report the incident to your local Department of Environment and Natural Resources office immediately.

""If you have been exposed to rabies, it is crucial you seek medical attention so preventative treatment for rabies is started as soon as possible,"" stated Friday's advisory, which also urged people to have their dogs vaccinated against rabies.

Rabid cat exposed to 6 people, 6 animals in Bennettsville
---------------------------------------------------------
A total of 6 people and 6 animals were exposed to a rabid cat in Marlboro County, according to the South Carolina Dept. of Health and Environmental Control.

On Thursday afternoon [16 Feb 2023], DHEC said its lab confirmed the rabies case in a stray, long-haired gray cat found Monday [13 Feb 2023] near Salem and Jackson Roads in Bennettsville.

Another 6 stray cats were exposed to the rabid feline, DHEC says, as well as 6 people. All 6 people have been referred to seek medical care.

If you believe your pet or someone you know may have come in contact with the rabid cat, you should contact DHEC's Florence office immediately.

""It is very important for you to seek medical attention if you have been exposed to a wild, stray, or domestic animal. The rabies virus is found in the saliva of infected animals and can be transmitted through a bite, scratch, broken skin, and the mucous membranes of your eyes, nose, or mouth. Immediately wash the affected area with plenty of soap and water,"" said Terri McCollister, rabies program team leader. ""Contact your local Environmental Affairs office for further guidance.""

This is the 1st positive rabies case for Marlboro County this year [2023]. Statewide, there have been 11 positive cases in 2023.

On 17 Feb 2023, the Stafford County Health Department confirmed an orange and white colored, short hair cat collected on 15 Feb 2023 from the 100 block of Ottinger Lane, off Widewater Road in Stafford County, was positive for rabies.

It's the 2nd case of detected rabies in a cat in the same area this month [February 2023].

The cat was a feral cat trapped in order to take it to the animal control shelter. There were confirmed human exposures through bites or scratches from the cat.

Three individuals were advised to obtain rabies post-exposure preventive treatment from the local hospital Emergency Department to prevent the development of human rabies.

The Health Department is notifying the public in case any people or pets may have had contact with this cat. Any individuals exposed/potentially exposed to this cat should seek medical advice promptly from their healthcare provider to evaluate whether rabies prevention medication is needed.

Individuals may also contact the Stafford County Environmental Health Office.

Likewise, if your pet was exposed/possibly exposed to this rabid cat or any potentially rabid animal, please consult your veterinarian promptly. In addition, please notify Stafford Animal Control and the Stafford County Environmental Health Department. On weekends or after hours, please call the Virginia Department of Health 24-hour answering service and ask for the staff member on call for the Rappahannock Area Health District.

Rabies is a disease caused by a virus attacking the nervous system. It is preventable in animals through vaccinations but fatal to animals and humans if not treated immediately.

Mount Rogers Health District confirms 2 cases of animal rabies
--------------------------------------------------------------
Two cases of rabies were identified in Carroll County last week.

According to the Mount Rogers Health District, on 22 Feb 2023 a skunk on the 300 block of Hunters Ridge Road in Dugspur entered a pen with a dog and the resident and displayed suspicious behavior. The skunk was collected and tested positive for rabies. The following day on 23 Feb 2023 a 2nd skunk was observed displaying unusual behavior in the same vicinity. This animal was tested Friday [24 Feb 2023] and was positive result for rabies as well. 

The Carroll County Health Department asks anyone who may have come into contact with a skunk in this area to call the health department or contact the area sheriff's office.

Rabies is a deadly disease caused by a virus which attacks the nervous system. Rabies can be prevented in cats, dogs, ferrets and some [most] livestock with a rabies vaccination. Rabies kills almost any mammal or human getting sick from it. The rabies virus is mainly in the saliva and brain tissue of rabid animals. It can be transmitted through a bite or by getting saliva or brain tissue in a wound or in the eye or mouth.

To protect pets and their owners from rabies, Virginia law requires all dogs and cats 4 months of age and older be vaccinated for rabies by a licensed veterinarian, and vaccinations be kept current.

The health district is reminding the public to avoid contact with bats, feral cats, stray dogs and wild animals, particularly in the area where the skunks were found.

Additional precautions
----------------------
• Do not feed stray animals. Avoid wild animals, especially raccoons, bats, foxes and skunks. Feed your pets indoors and do not let them wander.
• Make sure your pets are vaccinated against rabies and their shots are up-to-date. By law, all dogs, cats and ferrets must be vaccinated against rabies.
• Teach children to avoid contact with wild animals and pets they are not familiar with.
• Do not handle sick, injured or dead animals.
• Keep wild animals out of homes by capping chimneys with screens and blocking openings in attics, cellars and porches. Ensure trash cans have tight fitting lids.
• If you are bitten by a wild or stray animal, do not panic. Wash the wound(s) thoroughly with warm soapy water and contact animal control, your doctor or the health department for further recommendations.

.................................................sb/tg/may/mpp","Mount Rogers Health District confirms 2 cases of animal rabies--------------------------------------------------------------Two cases of rabies were identified in Carroll County last week.According to the Mount Rogers Health District, on 22 Feb 2023 a skunk on the 300 block of Hunters Ridge Road in Dugspur entered a pen with a dog and the resident and displayed suspicious behavior. The skunk was collected and tested positive for rabies. The following day on 23 Feb 2023 a 2nd skunk was observed displaying unusual behavior in the same vicinity. This animal was tested Friday [24 Feb 2023] and was positive result for rabies as well. The Carroll County Health Department asks anyone who may have come into contact with a skunk in this area to call the health department or contact the area sheriff's office.Rabies is a deadly disease caused by a virus which attacks the nervous system. Rabies can be prevented in cats, dogs, ferrets and some [most] livestock with a rabies vaccination. Rabies kills almost any mammal or human getting sick from it. The rabies virus is mainly in the saliva and brain tissue of rabid animals. It can be transmitted through a bite or by getting saliva or brain tissue in a wound or in the eye or mouth.To protect pets and their owners from rabies, Virginia law requires all dogs and cats 4 months of age and older be vaccinated for rabies by a licensed veterinarian, and vaccinations be kept current.The health district is reminding the public to avoid contact with bats, feral cats, stray dogs and wild animals, particularly in the area where the skunks were found.Additional precautions----------------------• Do not feed stray animals. Avoid wild animals, especially raccoons, bats, foxes and skunks. Feed your pets indoors and do not let them wander.• Make sure your pets are vaccinated against rabies and their shots are up-to-date. By law, all dogs, cats and ferrets must be vaccinated against rabies.• Teach children to avoid contact with wild animals and pets they are not familiar with.• Do not handle sick, injured or dead animals.• Keep wild animals out of homes by capping chimneys with screens and blocking openings in attics, cellars and porches. Ensure trash cans have tight fitting lids.• If you are bitten by a wild or stray animal, do not panic. Wash the wound(s) thoroughly with warm soapy water and contact animal control, your doctor or the health department for further recommendations.For additional information, visit <http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/environmental-epidemiology/animal-contact-human-health>.--Communicated by:ProMED from HealthMap Alerts[Rabies is a deadly disease to animals, and to humans.

An outbreak of distemper and ""Strep zoo"" [_Streptococcus equi_ subsp. _zooepidemicus_] in dogs is being addressed immediately by the City of El Paso Animal Service, city officials say.

According to a city press release, 20 dogs tested positive for canine distemper virus, a highly contagious and deadly disease in dogs after an animal service veterinarian noticed a high volume of respiratory illness. Additionally, 2 dogs tested positive for ""Strep zoo"", a rare pathogen in dogs.

Due to the outbreak, animal services will be closed to the public Saturday and Sunday [25-26 Feb 2023]. They will be deep cleaning all shelter grounds, including public areas. Lost pet reclaims and foster medical appointments will be the only services conducted via curbside service.

""Distemper is endemic to the borderland region, and most other southern states, which is why we continue to educate and encourage the community to vaccinate their pets,"" said Dr. Tony Chacon, El Paso animal services veterinarian. ""With over 700 dogs already in the shelter, the only way for us to protect the animals in the shelter and the community is to temporarily suspend non-emergency intake.""

Animal services has launched a testing plan to prevent further outbreaks, starting with dogs displaying signs of the disease, then testing asymptomatic dogs. Additionally, the department says safety protocols will include carefully monitoring healthy animals who may have been exposed.

[""_Streptococcus equi_ subsp. _zooepidemicus_ (_S. zooepidemicus_) has caused several outbreaks of haemorrhagic pneumonia in dogs in recent years. This highly contagious and often fatal disease is characterised by sudden onset of clinical signs including pyrexia, dypsnoea and haemorrhagic nasal discharge. Postmortem examination typically reveals pulmonary haemorrhage and pleural effusion. Histopathology demonstrates fibrino-suppurative, necrotizing and haemorrhagic pneumonia in most cases. The pathogenesis of _S. zooepidemicus_ infection in dogs is incompletely understood. Bacterial virulence factors as well as host factors may contribute to the severe outcome. _S. zooepidemicus_ occasionally causes zoonotic infections with potentially serious consequences. Canine vaccines for _S. zooepidemicus_ are currently not available, and prevention of the disease therefore relies on limiting bacterial spread by implementing stringent control measures in kennels. Further research, particularly sequence analysis of canine strains, is required to gain insights into epidemiology and pathogenesis of this emerging disease"" (<https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20570190/>). There is currently no vaccine for _S. zooepidemicus_.

The following information on canine distemper has been provided by the American Veterinary Medical Association (<https://www.avma.org/resources/pet-owners/petcare/canine-distemper>):

""Canine distemper is a contagious and serious disease caused by a virus that attacks the respiratory, gastrointestinal and nervous systems of puppies and dogs. The virus can also be found in wildlife such as foxes, wolves, coyotes, raccoons, skunks, mink and ferrets and has been reported in lions, tigers, leopards and other wild cats as well as seals.

""How is canine distemper spread? Puppies and dogs most often become infected through airborne exposure (through sneezing or coughing) to the virus from an infected dog or wild animal. The virus can also be transmitted by shared food and water bowls and equipment. Infected dogs can shed the virus for months, and mother dogs can pass the virus through the placenta to their puppies.

""Because canine distemper also impacts wildlife populations, contact between wild animals and domestic dogs can facilitate the spread of the virus. Canine distemper outbreaks in local raccoon populations can signal increased risk for pet dogs in the area.

""What dogs are at risk? All dogs are at risk but puppies younger than 4 months old and dogs that have not been vaccinated against canine distemper are at increased risk of acquiring the disease.

""What are the symptoms of canine distemper? Initially, infected dogs will develop watery to pus-like discharge from their eyes. They then develop fever, nasal discharge, coughing, lethargy, reduced appetite, and vomiting. As the virus attacks the nervous system, infected dogs develop circling behavior, head tilt, muscle twitches, convulsions with jaw chewing movements and salivation ('chewing gum fits'), seizures, and partial or complete paralysis. The virus may also cause the footpads to thicken and harden, leading to its nickname 'hard pad disease.'

""In wildlife, infection with canine distemper closely resembles rabies. Distemper is often fatal, and dogs surviving usually have permanent, irreparable nervous system damage.

""How is canine distemper diagnosed and treated? Veterinarians diagnose canine distemper through clinical appearance and laboratory testing. There is no cure for canine distemper infection. Treatment typically consists of supportive care and efforts to prevent secondary infections; control vomiting, diarrhea and neurologic symptoms; and combat dehydration through administration of fluids. Dogs infected with canine distemper must be separated from other dogs to minimize the risk of further infection.

""How is canine distemper prevented? Vaccination is crucial in preventing canine distemper.
- A series of vaccinations is administered to puppies to increase the likelihood of building immunity when the immune system has not yet fully matured.
- Avoid gaps in the immunization schedule and make sure distemper vaccinations are up to date.
- Avoid contact with infected animals and wildlife.
- Use caution when socializing puppies or unvaccinated dogs at parks, puppy classes, obedience classes, doggy day care and other places where dogs can congregate.
- Pet ferrets should be vaccinated against canine distemper using a USDA-approved ferret vaccine.""

Cases of bovine ephemeral fever, also known as 3-day sickness, have been reported in cattle in the area. The disease was confirmed through laboratory testing in herds across the Northern Rivers.

Three-day sickness is an insect-transmitted virus of cattle causing a high fever and pain in the muscles and joints. It is usually seen in cattle between 6 months and 2 years of age; however, if they are from outside the region, adult cattle can also experience the disease.

Affected cattle are often by themselves, off their feed, seek shade and water, shiver, drool and are lame. Signs usually last only a few days, and most cattle recover uneventfully.

Some cattle -- especially bulls and heavier conditioned cattle -- may go down and take several days to get back on their feet. Heavier cattle are at an increased risk of secondary complications as a result of being down. Pregnant cows may abort, and bulls may become infertile for up to 6 months. Milk production can drop significantly in lactating cows.

The virus appears on the North Coast in summer as the population of the biting insects which transmit the disease increases. The recent rainfall provides favourable conditions for the insect populations to increase rapidly.

Producers are encouraged to seek veterinary advice. Medication is highly effective in bringing down the fever and reducing the muscle and joint pain. Recovery tends to be quicker with less weight loss. There are several other diseases that may resemble 3-day sickness requiring alternative treatment, so veterinary diagnosis is essential.

A paddock with plenty of shade, water and feed and free of steep gullies is ideal for cattle to recover in. Any affected cattle should be provided with shade, water and feed and turned or lifted twice daily to help prevent secondary complications.

Recently recovered cattle should not be sent to the abattoirs for several weeks, to give the body a chance to heal and avoid the possibility of downgrades from any residual muscle damage.

For further advice, contact your North Coast Local Land Services District Veterinarian or private veterinary practitioner.

[It should be noted that bovine ephemeral fever is not a zoonotic disease. The following is excerpted from Fenner's Veterinary Virology, 5th edition (<https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/bovine-ephemeral-fever>):

.................................................sb/tg/rd/mpp","Cases of bovine ephemeral fever, also known as 3-day sickness, have been reported in cattle in the area. The disease was confirmed through laboratory testing in herds across the Northern Rivers.Three-day sickness is an insect-transmitted virus of cattle causing a high fever and pain in the muscles and joints. It is usually seen in cattle between 6 months and 2 years of age; however, if they are from outside the region, adult cattle can also experience the disease.Affected cattle are often by themselves, off their feed, seek shade and water, shiver, drool and are lame. Signs usually last only a few days, and most cattle recover uneventfully.Some cattle -- especially bulls and heavier conditioned cattle -- may go down and take several days to get back on their feet. Heavier cattle are at an increased risk of secondary complications as a result of being down. Pregnant cows may abort, and bulls may become infertile for up to 6 months. Milk production can drop significantly in lactating cows.The virus appears on the North Coast in summer as the population of the biting insects which transmit the disease increases. The recent rainfall provides favourable conditions for the insect populations to increase rapidly.Producers are encouraged to seek veterinary advice. Medication is highly effective in bringing down the fever and reducing the muscle and joint pain. Recovery tends to be quicker with less weight loss. There are several other diseases that may resemble 3-day sickness requiring alternative treatment, so veterinary diagnosis is essential.A paddock with plenty of shade, water and feed and free of steep gullies is ideal for cattle to recover in. Any affected cattle should be provided with shade, water and feed and turned or lifted twice daily to help prevent secondary complications.Recently recovered cattle should not be sent to the abattoirs for several weeks, to give the body a chance to heal and avoid the possibility of downgrades from any residual muscle damage.For further advice, contact your North Coast Local Land Services District Veterinarian or private veterinary practitioner.[Byline: Susanna Freymark]--Communicated by:ProMED[It should be noted that bovine ephemeral fever is not a zoonotic disease.

The 1st outbreak of the African swine fever virus in 2023 was detected in Primorsky, the Primorsky Interregional Directorate of Rosselkhoznadzor [Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance] reported on Monday [20 Feb 2023].

""The protocol of the Primorsky interregional veterinary laboratory of Rosselkhoznadzor dated 17 Feb 2023, confirmed a case of African swine fever (ASF) virus in the wild in the Khasan district. In particular, DNA of the African swine fever virus was found in the studied samples of pathological material taken from the corpse of a wild boar, found in a forest in the Khasan district,"" the agency said.

In the summer of 2019, ASF was first recorded in Primorsky, which for 3 years forced the authorities to introduce quarantine measures in different regions of the region. The last focus of African swine fever was discovered and eradicated in the Border Region of Primorsky in the spring of 2022. Specialists of hunting supervision and protected natural areas note that the number of wild boar declined dramatically during the fight against ASF. This was one of the reasons why tigers began to come out to settlements in the Far East more often in search of food.

ASF (Montgomery's disease) was first recorded in 1903 in South Africa. The virus does not pose a threat to humans but is extremely dangerous for wild and domestic pigs [and lapses in biosecurity measures favor the spread of the disease]. The disease is rapidly spreading among animals and causing serious damage to agriculture. Due to the consequences of the virus, the authorities of Primorsky in January [2023] imposed a ban on all types of wild boar hunting until 2025, since the wild boar is food for the Amur tiger and a further decline in the number of wild boar may adversely affect the population of this predator.

[African swine fever (ASF) is a devastating hemorrhagic fever of pigs with extremely high mortality rates. In affected countries, it causes huge economic losses. The importance of wildlife reservoirs for disease maintenance has been clearly demonstrated. In Eastern Europe, the disease spread into the local wild boar populations.

It is interesting that the report highlights a potential conservation impact of AFS, by the cascading effect on food shortage for Amur tigers. - Mod.PMB

The Ministry of Health has just issued a statement confirming the discovery of a second case of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) in Prey Veng province -- the father of an 11-year-old girl who died from the virus on Wednesday [22 Feb 2023].

The outbreak is centered around Roleang village, Romlech commune, Sithor Kandal district, Prey Veng province.

The Ministry says that after the girl's death, the emergency research work team of the Ministry of Health in collaboration with local authorities and Prey Veng Provincial Health Department, together with health partners, arrived at the village immediately on [23 Feb 2023].

The emergency response team collected samples from 12 people. One of the 12 samples -- taken from a 49-year-old man living in Roleang village -- has been confirmed as positive. The Ministry of Health states that the virus was not previously found in humans for the past 9 years in the Kingdom of Cambodia. The emergency response team has been investigating the outbreak of the H5N1 virus, is responding to national procedures, and has been working with the emergency response team, human, and veterinary vets, to find the source of the infection.

Animals and humans will continue to be tested for suspected cases to prevent transmission to others in the community in the village where the incident occurred. Public health expert Dr Quach Mengly said the disease has symptoms similar to a cold, cough, and fever and is highly life-threatening without treatment. ""To prevent the infection, please avoid touching and eating sick and dead animals,"" he said. ""Bury the dead animals properly, and wash your hands properly after that.""

Influenza A virus subtype H5N1 (A/H5N1) is a subtype of the influenza A virus which can cause illness in humans and many other animal species. A bird-adapted strain of H5N1, called HPAI A(H5N1) for highly pathogenic avian influenza virus of type A of subtype H5N1, is the highly pathogenic causative agent of H5N1 flu, commonly known as avian influenza (""bird flu""). It is enzootic (maintained in the population) in many bird populations, especially in Southeast Asia.

Cambodia has tested at least 12 people for the H5N1 strain of avian influenza, the health ministry said, after an 11-year-old girl died this week from the virus in the 1st known transmission to humans in the country in nearly a decade.

The victim's father, who was part of a group the girl had been in contact with in a province east of the capital Phnom Penh, tested positive for the virus but did not exhibit any symptoms, Health Minister Mam Bunheng said in a statement on Friday [24 Feb 2023].

The statement did not disclose the test results of others in the group and did not specify how the victim's father had contracted the virus, commonly known as bird flu.

The girl's case was the 1st known human infection with the H5N1 strain in the Southeast Asian country since 2014, Bunheng had said on Thursday [23 Feb 2023].

The girl from Prey Veng province was diagnosed with bird flu after falling sick with a high fever and cough on 16 Feb 2023, the statement said. When her condition deteriorated, she was transferred to the National Children's Hospital in Phnom Penh but died on Wednesday [22 Feb 2023], the health ministry said.

Since early last year [2022], bird flu has ravaged farms around the world, leading to the deaths of more than 200 million birds because of the disease or mass culls, the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) recently told Reuters.

The World Health Organization (WHO) earlier this month [February 2023] noted the spread to mammals of H5N1 influenza but said the risk to humans remained low.

H5N1 had spread among poultry and wild birds for 25 years, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a briefing, but recent reports of infections in mink, otters, and sea lions ""need to be monitored closely.""

Cambodian health authorities urged people not to handle dead or sick animals and birds, and to contact a hotline if anyone suspected they had been infected by the disease.

A study by researchers from several Spanish centers published in the journal Eurosurveillance [see reference below], has indicated that the asymptomatic cases of H5N1 avian influenza in 2 workers at a chicken farm in Guadalajara [Castille-La Mancha] detected in the fall of 2022 were not real infections but, ""most likely"", the product of environmental contamination.

For the authors, ""the absence of symptoms in both workers together with the laboratory results, which showed a very low viral load and the absence of specific H5 antibodies against the A/H5 virus, suggested that the positive PCR results were most likely due to environmental contamination.""

An outbreak of avian influenza was confirmed in a poultry farm in Guadalajara on 20 Sep 2022. After that, 2 workers tested positive in a PCR test. They were in charge, among other tasks, of collecting eggs and performing routine cleaning tasks.

Neither of them had symptoms and both remained in self-isolation from the 1st positive result until a 2nd negative sample was obtained 6 days later in one case, and 9 days later in the other. Given the cases and the increasing number of outbreaks of avian influenza, there has been growing concern about the possible occurrence of human cases.

For Gustavo del Real, from the National Institute for Agricultural and Food Research and Technology (INIA-CSIC), this work clearly and thoroughly describes all the epidemiological control steps carried out in relation to the outbreak, caused by the highly virulent strain of the H5N1 subtype.

""Apparently, there has been no significant proliferation in human cells and the positivity is a consequence of the high sensitivity of the test. It should be noted that the concentration of virus particles in the air or on the premises of the affected farm can be immense given the large number of affected birds, tens of thousands, which release virus to the outside.""

Likewise, Elisa Pérez, also from INIA, stated that the results are interesting, but not surprising. ""It had already been commented on many occasions that these 2 positive cases in the workers of the Guadalajara farm were possibly false positives.""

One of the 12 contacts tested in Cambodia, the father of the girl who died, tested positive. Based on the timeline the test was most likely PCR-based. The 2nd article above notes the individual was asymptomatic so it begs the question if he was actually infected or if the sample was positive due to environmental contamination. It is particularly important to rule out the latter, as demonstrated by the 3rd article above, highlighting the very real risk of environmental contamination leading to false positive PCR tests.

Hopefully local authorities in Cambodia will follow up with serology on all 12 close contacts to determine how many seroconverted, which would give a better idea of true infection rates and rule out environmental contamination. Genomic sequencing with/without virus isolation could also help establish the chain(s) of transmission.

We are also still within the incubation window for additional cases if the 1st case turns into a human-to-human point source. As previous posts noted, if any exposed/infected animals are still in the area they remain an ongoing risk for spillover as well.

Any additional information on test results from humans or animals in the area would be greatly appreciated as this event, now involving 2 human cases plus as yet unidentified dead animals in the area, continues to be worrisome from the standpoint of human-to-human transmission. - Mod.JH]

They were in charge, among other tasks, of collecting eggs and performing routine cleaning tasks.Neither of them had symptoms and both remained in self-isolation from the 1st positive result until a 2nd negative sample was obtained 6 days later in one case, and 9 days later in the other. Given the cases and the increasing number of outbreaks of avian influenza, there has been growing concern about the possible occurrence of human cases.For Gustavo del Real, from the National Institute for Agricultural and Food Research and Technology (INIA-CSIC), this work clearly and thoroughly describes all the epidemiological control steps carried out in relation to the outbreak, caused by the highly virulent strain of the H5N1 subtype.""Apparently, there has been no significant proliferation in human cells and the positivity is a consequence of the high sensitivity of the test. It should be noted that the concentration of virus particles in the air or on the premises of the affected farm can be immense given the large number of affected birds, tens of thousands, which release virus to the outside.""Likewise, Elisa Pérez, also from INIA, stated that the results are interesting, but not surprising. ""It had already been commented on many occasions that these 2 positive cases in the workers of the Guadalajara farm were possibly false positives.""--Communication by:ProMED via ProMED-ESP[ProMED map of Castille-La Mancha, Spain: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8708580,4943>Reference:----------Aznar E, Casas I, González Praetorius A, et al.

11 patients have been found positive with a unique epitype of the bacterium _Enterobacter hormaechei_. What the patients have in common is that they have taken the medicine dicloxacillin in capsules from the same manufacturer. The outbreak has been discovered via the national surveillance of multi-resistant bacteria, which SSI carries out in collaboration with the clinical microbiology departments. SSI follows the development in the number of new cases.

Carbapenemase-producing organisms (CPO) are a group of bacteria that can be difficult to treat because they are resistant to the antibiotics normally used to treat serious infections. In Denmark, CPO infection is most often seen after traveling abroad or during outbreaks in Danish hospitals. In 2021, a total of 221 patients with carbapenemase-producing intestinal bacteria, which make up the majority of CPO, were detected in Denmark.

Description of the disease outbreak
----------------------------------------------
From October 2022 to January 2023, 9 CPO patients with the same unique epitype were registered: 2 cases in October 2022, 2 cases in December 2022, and 5 cases in January 2023. The cases had no relation to each other, there was no suspicion that the infection had occurred in hospital or during travel. The epitype found was so unique and characteristic that the clinical microbiology departments were contacted to clarify the cause of the outbreak.

Odense University Hospital's clinical microbiology department subsequently noticed that 3 patients who had tested positive in their laboratory had received treatment with Dicillin® capsules shortly before the outbreak bacteria was detected. They examined unopened packages of Dicillin® and found that the CPO bacteria could be grown from the surface of a capsule of Dicillin® 500 mg. Furthermore, other clinical microbiology departments and the SSI were able to confirm that all patients had been prescribed Dicillin® from the same manufacturer prior to a positive test finding of the epitype.

Against this background, the drug manufacturer Sandoz has recalled the drug Dicillin®.

A single case has been found in Iceland with the same unique outbreak bacterium, where the patient was also prescribed the same drug.

None of the Danish patients have become ill from the bacteria, and none have received treatment for the bacteria. 2 of the patients have died due to serious underlying disease, but there is no evidence that this is due to the outbreak bacteria.

As part of the investigation into the outbreak, the doctors of the affected patients have been interviewed. In continuation of this, it has now been confirmed that 2 patients in 2020 with the same unique epitype also consumed the same drug shortly before detection.

The situation is closely monitored in close cooperation with the Danish Medicines Agency, the Danish Health Authority, and the Statens Serum Institut. After the recall, a closer investigation of the outbreak will now take place, and SSI will continuously monitor whether new cases with the same type of bacteria should be discovered in collaboration with the country's clinical microbiology departments.

SSI follows up on all new suspected cases with typing of the bacteria and an interview with the patient's doctor.

Especially for healthcare professionals
---------------------------------------
Patients admitted with infection who received Dicillin® during the period September 2022-February 2023 should be investigated for CPO according to local guidelines. Until an answer is available, isolation is not recommended, but the patient is to be instructed in good hand hygiene in connection with visits to the toilet.

For patients who have received Dicillin® and who turn to their own doctor, specialist practice, outpatient clinics, etc., it is recommended that they be examined and treated as usual.

The outbreak bacterium is an intestinal bacterium that is no more disease-causing or contagious than other bacteria. Most often, you just want the bacteria in your gut, as part of your gut flora. The outbreak bacterium has so far only been seen in people who have received treatment with Dicillin®. No spread of the outbreak bacteria between patients has been seen.

The outbreak bacterium is resistant to an antibiotic commonly used to treat infections in hospitalized patients. The outbreak bacterium can still be treated, as the outbreak bacterium is sensitive to several other antibiotics. If the person has an infection with the outbreak bacteria and needs to be treated, there are several options for effective treatment.

[Dicillin is a brand name for dicloxacillin in Denmark, an orally administered beta-lactam antibiotic of the penicillin class that is active against Gram-positive cocci, including methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MSSA) and streptococci, in particular, beta-lactamase (penicillinase)-producing _Staphylococcus aureus_ that are resistant to penicillin. However, methicillin-resistant _S. aureus_ (MRSA) are resistant to dicloxacillin.

The reports above say that 9 patients (who are not related) were colonized (but not infected) by the same carbapenemase-positive organism, now identified as _Enterobacter hormaechei_ sequence type 79, in the past 4 months (October 2022 to January 2023) in Denmark. These patients had been treated with Dicillin® (500 mg capsules) from the pharmaceutical company Sandoz. _E. hormaechei_ sequence type 79 was then identified on the surface of a capsule of Dicillin® 500 mg taken from previously unopened packages of Dicillin®.

In addition, one person in Iceland who had taken dicloxacillin manufactured by Sandoz in July 2022 was said to have developed an ""infection"" with the same bacterium identified in the 9 patients in Denmark. Also, this organism was isolated from 2 patients in 2020 in Denmark who had taken Dicillin® shortly before isolation of _E. hormaechei_ sequence type 79.

It is likely that several lots of dicloxacillin manufactured by Sandoz, called Dicillin® in Denmark and Staklox® in Iceland, have been contaminated since affected patients are located in 2 different European countries, and dates of exposure extend from 2020 to 2023. All dicloxacillin is being recalled by Sandoz in Denmark and Iceland. However, we are not told which lots of dicloxacillin are affected, where the affected lots of the drug were manufactured and bottled, or how widely these lots have been distributed.

More information on this outbreak would be greatly appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Heartland virus (HRTV) disease is an emerging tick-borne illness in the midwestern and southern United States. We describe a reported fatal case of HRTV infection in the Maryland and Virginia region, states not widely recognized to have human HRTV disease cases. The range of HRTV could be expanding in the United States.

The study
---------
The patient was a man in his late 60s who had a medical history of splenectomy from remote trauma, coronary artery disease, and hypertension. He was seen at an emergency department in November 2021 for 5 days of fever, nonbloody diarrhea, dyspnea, myalgias, and malaise. At initial examination, he appeared fatigued but was alert and oriented.

The patient had homes in rural areas of Maryland and Virginia and had not traveled outside this area in the previous 3 months. He spent time outdoors on his properties but did not recall attached ticks or tick bites.

On day 7 after symptom onset, the patient returned to the emergency department with confusion, an unsteady gait, and new fecal and urinary incontinence; he was admitted for inpatient management. He had progressive encephalopathy with hyponatremia and rising transaminases (Table).

The patient's clinical course continued to deteriorate. He had acute respiratory failure, renal failure, and cardiac arrest. He was transitioned to comfort care and died on day 13 after symptom onset.

Conclusions
-----------
HRTV disease has been reported in > 50 patients in states across the midwestern and southern United States (1-7). A bite from an _Amblyomma americanum_ tick is the only known means of environmental HRTV transmission (1). Corresponding to _A. americanum_ tick seasonal activity, all reported cases have occurred during April-September, and symptoms developed during June in most case patients (1,3). Because the incubation period for HRTV is estimated to be 2 weeks, this patient was likely infected in late October. Adult ticks are minimally active at that time; however, larval ticks can become infected with HRTV and can still be observed during October (1,14). We suspect this patient was bitten by larval ticks unknowingly because of their small size, and that the bite marks healed before his clinical signs and symptoms appeared.

Maryland and Virginia fall within the _A. americanum_ tick distribution area, but we found no previous reports of HRTV illness from those states during a literature search, and CDC had no reported cases from those states. Among 193 ticks collected during tick drags of both properties, no HRTV-infected vectors were found, but this result does not exclude HRTV in either state. Previous studies report low overall minimum infection rates among _A. americanum_ ticks from other states, ranging from 0.4 to 11/1000 ticks (1 infected tick/90-2174 collected) (1,8,10,11). We suspect the Virginia property was the likely location of infection, based on the number of ticks VDH collected while sampling an area that the patient frequented 10-14 days before symptom onset and because fewer ticks were collected from the Maryland property (Appendix).

The patient's clinical and laboratory findings were consistent with HLH [hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis] secondary to HRTV infection. HLH has been documented in several cases of infection with the related _Bandavirus_, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus, and in at least 1 case of HRTV infection (1,4). Reports showed corticosteroids and ribavirin did not effectively treat severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome-triggered HLH, but preliminary clinical data shows potential benefit from favipiravir (1,15). Currently, clinical management for HRTV infection is supportive care (3).

We hypothesize that HRTV infection is underrecognized and mainly diagnosed when severe disease leads to additional testing at referral centers. Although lack of responsiveness to appropriate antimicrobial agents for bacterial tickborne illness might suggest severe disease (2), self-limited disease likely is undiagnosed or diagnosed as another tickborne disease. Because tick ranges are increasing overall, incidence of previously regional tickborne infections, such as HRTV, likely will continue to increase. Expanding testing capabilities for arbovirus and tick-borne infections, including multiplex testing, would enable real-time assessment and management of patients with potential arboviral and other tick-borne infections.

This article reports a Heartland virus (HRTV) human infection in a new locality in the US: Maryland or, more likely, Virginia. The geographic area where HRTV infections have occurred in humans has been increasing in the eastern and midwestern states. The CDC indicates that as of November 2022, Heartland virus disease cases have been identified in residents from Arkansas, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Virginia (<https://www.cdc.gov/heartland-virus/statistics/index.html>). The Virginia case may be the one described in the report above.

A 2015 report indicates that HRTV infects wildlife over an even wider geographic area. Of 1428 animals, 103 were seropositive: 55 deer, 33 raccoons, 11 coyotes, and 4 moose. 13 states had seropositive animals: Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Vermont (see reference below). The geographic range of infected wildlife will likely have widened over the 8 years since that study was published.

It would be interesting to have additional surveillance of human cases with clinical pictures compatible with HRTV infections, not only in the states where the CDC reports cases but in surrounding ones and in a broader geographic area where antibodies are found in wild mammals. Surveillance of _A. americanum_ ticks would also be of interest. - Mod.TY

The geographic range of infected wildlife will likely have widened over the 8 years since that study was published.Reference---------Riemersma KK, Komar N.

Emerg Infect Dis. 2015; 21(10): 1830-1833; <https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2110.150380>It would be interesting to have additional surveillance of human cases with clinical pictures compatible with HRTV infections, not only in the states where the CDC reports cases but in surrounding ones and in a broader geographic area where antibodies are found in wild mammals. Surveillance of _A. americanum_ ticks would also be of interest. - Mod.TYProMED maps:Maryland, United States: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8708571,223>Virginia, United States: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8708571,247>]",Emerging Infectious Diseases journal,,

[2] Belgium: persistent morbidity in clade IIb mpox patients

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While mpox was well characterised during the 2022 global clade IIb outbreak, little is known about persistent morbidity. We present interim results of a prospective cohort study of 95 mpox patients assessed 3-20 weeks post-symptom onset. Two-thirds of participants had residual morbidity, including 25 with persistent anorectal and 18 with genital symptoms. Loss of physical fitness, new-onset/worsened fatigue and mental health problems were reported in 36, 19 and 11 patients, respectively. These findings require attention by healthcare providers.

Adenovirus has claimed another life in West Bengal. The victim is a Kharagpur-born 13-year-old girl. Throughout the previous week, she was admitted to Peerless Hospital. The young girl's name is [UR]. She reportedly succumbed to death on 22 Feb 2023 at 8:30 AM, local media reports claimed.

The girl, who had been diagnosed with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Type 2 at the age of 2, was undergoing treatment at the Kolkata hospital for the past one week.

[UR] began having trouble walking and getting out of bed at a young age. She was able to sit and stand with the use of a knee, ankle and foot orthosis (KAFO), but she was unable to walk unassisted. She was a girl with special needs.

[UR] wanted to pursue higher studies and aspired to be a classical singer. Her family hoped that her wings would not be tied by the shackles of this dreadful disease that was taking away her abilities bit by bit, tweeted Cure SMA India in February 2019.

Adenovirus is the 3rd greatest worry after coronavirus and dengue. Before this, 11 children reportedly passed away this winter due to the virus in West Bengal. Health workers in Kolkata have been told to be more alert about flu-like symptoms in youngsters in order to identify and treat probable adenovirus cases early.

Ms. Youk Sambath, secretary of state of the Ministry of Health, has confirmed that the Ministry of Health's emergency response team has found 12 more people infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) in Prey Veng province.

The news follows the death yesterday of an 11-year-old girl from HPAI A(H5N1) in Roleang village, Romlech commune, Sithor Kandal district, Prey Veng province.

The secretary of state stated that 4 of the affected people have begun to show symptoms. She added that the emergency response team took their samples for analysis at a laboratory in Phnom Penh, and the results will be released tomorrow [24 Feb 2023].

Ms. Youk Sambath also said that the Ministry of Health's emergency response team will continue to search for those affected by bird flu in schools tomorrow [24 Feb 2023].

With the discovery of the infected people, Ms. Youk Sambath called on the villagers to increase vigilance and health care and follow the instructions of professional officials.

Influenza A virus subtype H5N1 (A/H5N1) is a subtype of the influenza A virus that can cause illness in humans and many other animal species.

A bird-adapted strain of H5N1, called HPAI A(H5N1) for highly pathogenic avian influenza virus of type A of subtype H5N1, is the highly pathogenic causative agent of H5N1 flu, commonly known as avian influenza (""bird flu"").

It is enzootic (maintained in the population) in many bird populations, especially in Southeast Asia.

[It appears that the above text referring to 12 more confirmed cases is in error since the results are still pending. The 4 symptomatic cases would seem to be highly suggestive of either a larger transmission event from the animal point source, or evidence of human-to-human transmission. It will be important to rule the latter out via monitoring as well as ensuring that any symptomatic animals are appropriately euthanized and disposed of to eliminate any further virus spillover. - Mod.JH

A team of scientists led by Cornell University has recently confirmed the 1st cases of canine distemper virus (CDV) in tigers and leopards in Nepal. This virus, usually affecting dogs, can cause fatal neurological diseases and thus be a significant threat to already dwindling big cat populations.

""Canine distemper virus has been repeatedly identified as a threat to wild carnivores and their conservation,"" said study senior author Martin Gilbert, a wild carnivore health specialist at Cornell. ""This study is a 1st step to understanding the potential impact for Nepalese tiger and leopard populations.""

Although scientists have already suspected that CDV can infect big cats, this is the 1st definitive proof of infection in Nepal. The experts found that 11 percent of tigers (3 out of 28) and 30 percent of leopards (6 out of 20) had antibodies to this virus, indicating that they had been infected in the past.

While relatively little is known about Nepal's leopards, studies suggest that their population is in decline due to a mixture of poaching, habitat loss, and human-wildlife conflicts. Moreover, they are also facing increasing competition caused by the expansion of the country's tiger population, which has tripled over the past 12 years (although, globally, this species remains endangered too).

As the larger and stronger species, tigers are frequently displacing leopards from national parks into areas with more people, where they often prey on street dogs. According to the researchers, these dogs may be the source of infection. ""We already know CDV is circulating in the Nepali dog population, and that leopards frequently eat dogs, while tigers do not,"" said study co-author Jessica Bodgener, a veterinarian at Wildlife Vets International.

""When we found a greater exposure in leopards, it seemed like a good fit, but we need more evidence to be sure. And we can't forget 3 tigers also tested positive. If tigers aren't eating dogs, it raises the question, how did these animals get infected? The situation may not be straightforward."" Other species, such as jackals or civets, could also act as reservoirs.

The scientists recommend several immediate actions to control the spread of the virus, including raising awareness of wildlife managers, expanding molecular testing and genetic sequencing of leopards and tigers, continuing to monitor the presence of antibodies, vaccinating dogs and potentially the big cats themselves, and -- since small, isolated populations are most at risk of CDV outbreaks -- increasing habitat connectivity through wildlife corridors.

""Since 2014, we have seen 10 leopards showing neurological disease that could be consistent with CDV infection. With increased awareness, we plan to confirm future cases and obtain genetic sequences to help determine the source of infections,"" concluded co-author Amir Sadaula, a veterinarian at the National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC).

The pathogen flow at the carnivore wildlife-domestic interface is a major conservation concern, especially where feral dogs are abundant. Documentation of outbreaks in wild carnivores due to exposure to cat and dog pathogens abound throughout the world.

There have been reports of wild tigers dying due to CDV infection in Russia. Recent research suggested that native carnivores seem to be playing a role in maintaining CDV in the absence of dogs.

It is important to consider that canine distemper is not the only pathogen that domestic and wild carnivores can transmit to tigers.

There have been efforts to develop an anti-CDV vaccine to be used in tigers can be a powerful tool to avoid extinction. - Mod.PMB

As temperatures rapidly change across India, many are falling sick to viral infections and flu-like cases, exacerbated by worsening pollution in many of our cities. However, in addition to this usual set of seasonal illnesses, a new contender has been wreaking havoc across West Bengal: the adenovirus.

Since the beginning of winter [2022], the disease has claimed 11 lives -- most prominently children -- and the virus was detected in 32% of respiratory infection samples tested by the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases (ICMR-NICED). As a result, hospital beds across the city are filling up quickly, with the adenovirus being a significant contributor.

What are the symptoms of adenovirus infection?
Adenoviruses typically manifest as mild cold- or flu-like symptoms in people of all ages. However, it is more common in babies and young children. While serious illness is uncommon, it can become severe for people with weakened immune systems or those with existing respiratory or cardiac problems.

According to the Centre for Disease Control (CDC), the illness can lead to common cold-like symptoms, fever, sore throat, acute bronchitis, pneumonia, conjunctivitis, as well as acute gastroenteritis, frequent peeing, and a burning sensation during peeing. These symptoms can last 2 days to weeks after contact with the virus.

How does an adenovirus infection spread?
Similar to other viral infections, adenoviruses are highly contagious and are commonly spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or even through close personal contact such as touching an infected person or shaking their hands.

Additionally, it can also spread if someone touches their mouth, nose, and eyes after touching an object or surface contaminated with the virus. In rare cases, it can also pass through stools, such as during diaper changes.

How do I protect myself against adenoviruses?
The CDC urges people to frequently wash their hands with soap and water, and follow proper hygiene etiquette. In addition, as with COVID-19, avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands. It goes without saying that we should avoid close contact with infected since the disease is airborne.

You should call the doctor if you suspect your baby might have the virus or a weak immune system since symptoms could significantly worsen. Do also notify them if you have a high fever that persists for more than a few days, have problems with your vision, or are experiencing severe diarrhoea and vomiting.

What is the treatment for adenovirus infections?
There are no approved vaccines or antiviral medicines for patients with adenovirus infection. Since most cases are mild, symptoms can be managed by over-the-counter pain and fever medicines in the prescribed doses.

If you have the disease, get ample rest and drink plenty of fluids. Humidifiers and nose drops may help with any congestion. However, infants, babies, and children may need more intense care, such as treatment in a hospital with IV fluids, oxygen, and breathing treatment.

Which adenovirus strain is currently impacting West Bengal?
According to the ICMR-NICED, the current spike in cases can be attributed to a combination of strains 3 and 7 of the adenovirus. While strain 3 is the most commonly found genotype of the virus, strain 7 is the deadliest out of the over 100 adenovirus strains [more than 50 that can cause disease in humans] that we are aware of, making this pairing especially harmful and a cause for significant concern.

[Adenoviruses can cause cold-like symptoms including fever, sore throat, pneumonia, diarrhea, and/or conjunctivitis. Adenovirus infection can strike at any age although the young, the old, and those that are immunocompromised are disproportionately affected. Adenovirus types 3, 4, and 7 are typically associated with respiratory illness, with type 7 having an association with more severe disease outcomes. It is not surprising that types 3 and 7 were both found in circulation, especially with multiple other respiratory pathogens in the mix globally, including COVID-19, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). - Mod.JH

The Middlesex-London Health Unit and Southwestern Public Health continue to investigate a confirmed case of measles in the region.

According to the health unit, the person who lives in London and works in Woodstock was infected while travelling outside Canada.

After their return home, the person reportedly had contact with people at a London medical clinic on Tue 14 Feb 2023 between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m., and during overnight work shifts at Nova Steel in Woodstock on 9 and 12 Feb 2023 between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m.

""Public health was notified of this case late Friday afternoon [17 Feb 2023]. We have been able to determine their potential contacts and are following up with those people to make sure they are aware of the situation and to prevent the spread of further illness,"" said Medical Officer of Health, Dr Alex Summers.

If you were exposed at Nova Steel on 9/10 or 12/13 Feb 2023, you are asked to monitor yourself for symptoms.

If you are not fully vaccinated with 2 doses of measles-containing vaccine, have not had measles in the past, or if you develop symptoms, please call Southwestern Public Health at 1-800-922- 0096 and ask to speak to the public health inspector on call.

Measles is spread through the air and complications can include pneumonia, ear infections, brain infections, other infections, and in rare cases, death.

Individuals who have received the measles-containing vaccine, who have been previously infected with measles, or who were born before 1970, are generally protected from infection.

At least 55 measles cases have been recorded in the Dadaab refugee camp in Kenya on the border with Somalia as of 22 Dec 2022, the World Health Organization has said.

The WHO in the Emergency Situational Updates published on Tuesday [21 Feb 2023] said the camp has also recorded an increase in cholera with a total of 504 cases reported.

""Furthermore, an outbreak of measles has been reported in Kakuma refugee camp where an additional 20 000 refugees arrived recently,"" WHO said in the update.

The global health agency has further warned that the January-March 2023 dry season is likely to reverse any recovery the ASALs [arid and semi-arid lands] may have made ahead of the next.

According to WHO, the impact of the October-November-December (OND) ""short rains"" has been insignificant to local livelihoods as it only provided limited relief mainly in water access for some parts of the ASAL counties.

""In terms of refugees, the camps have more than 3 times the intended capacity.""

WHO estimates that the Greater Horn of Africa (GHoA) region is hosting approximately 4.4 million refugees and asylum-seekers, the majority are from South Sudan (2.21 million).

""Approximately 13.5 million people are internally displaced as a result of conflict and drought, among other factors,"" WHO said.

WHO estimates that currently, 571 000 refugees are living in Kenya.

Last week [week of 13 Feb 2023], the government revealed a plan to integrate willing refugees into local communities.

[3] Congo DR: project update

<https://www.msf.org/measles-drc-never-ending-fight-against-one-world%E2%80%99s-most-contagious-diseases>


Every 2-3 years, measles outbreaks affect tens or even hundreds of thousands of children in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Last year [2022] was no exception, with more than 148 600 cases and 1800 deaths reported. How can this recurring emergency be explained? And, above all, how can we put an end to it?

When one speaks of an emergency in DRC, the problem of measles is rarely the 1st image that comes to mind. Yet this disease regularly wreaks havoc on young children, the main victims of measles, and has been the primary reason for intervention by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) emergency teams in DRC for years.

We have 5 emergency teams mobilised almost around the clock to respond to the various measles outbreaks throughout the country. But as soon as we put out a fire here, it flares up on the other side, says Dr Louis Massing, MSF medical referent in DRC.

In 2022, we carried out 45 measles-related emergency interventions; that's more than 3/4 of our emergency response in DRC.

The largest measles outbreak ever documented in DRC occurred between 2018 and 2020. At that time, nearly 460 000 children contracted the disease, and 8000 of them died. Large-scale vaccination campaigns had been organised by the health authorities, supported by international partners such as MSF, enabling the number of cases to be drastically reduced by 2021.

But last year [2023], nearly 1/2 of the country's health zones were again in an epidemic situation, says Dr Massing. And it's not over. In January 2023 alone, close to 20 000 suspect cases of measles have been notified in DRC and our teams have already responded to measles outbreaks in Tshopo, Maniema, South Kivu, North Kivu, Lomami, and Lualaba provinces.

Everyone must be protected
Measles is one of the most contagious diseases in the world. Fortunately, a vaccine exists and offers almost complete protection when a person is inoculated twice. Since a person carrying the virus can infect up to 90 per cent of the unvaccinated people around him or her, ensuring maximum vaccination coverage is vital. This requires massive investments in routine vaccination, surveillance, and catch-up campaigns.

""The fight against measles is like a chain around the virus: if one link is broken, the virus can escape,"" says Dr Massing. ""First, the country must ensure that sufficient quantities of vaccine are available to avoid stock-outs at health facilities. Then, it is necessary to ensure that the vaccines are delivered to the health facilities and that they have an efficient cold chain to keep the vaccines stored in good conditions.""

It is also necessary to have staff on site to vaccinate children during consultations, and for families to have the economic and physical means to go there. ""Finally, regular catch-up campaigns must be organised to protect children who fall through the cracks... Given the virulence of measles, there can be no weak links,"" says Dr Massing.

Unfortunately, many elements of that chain are weak in DRC, and this situation is further aggravated by security constraints, geographic challenges to reach many areas, and the country's high birth rate, with over two million babies born every year who need to be protected from the disease.

As a result, despite emergency campaigns conducted during each outbreak, immunisation coverage remains insufficient. While coverage estimates can vary widely from one source to another, the latest estimates from UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO) indicate that by 2021, only 55 per cent of children were covered by one dose of the measles vaccine. A minimum coverage of 95 per cent with 2 doses is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.

""Some areas can only be reached by dugout canoe, or even on foot through the forest,"" says Alexis Mpesha, logistics manager for one of MSF's emergency teams in DRC. ""It is not uncommon for our teams to be the only ones to reach certain villages because the local health authorities do not have the equipment, fuel, or human resources to get there.""

For parents wishing to have their children vaccinated, the distance to a functioning health centre, transportation costs, and sometimes consultation fees can be discouraging. ""Care is expensive and our resources are limited,"" says a native of Bangabola village, where MSF responded to a measles outbreak in 2022. ""Some children die just because their parents don't have money to pay for treatment.""

Boosting immunisation is urgently needed
MSF teams, in support of the Ministry of Health, organise vaccination campaigns and set up treatment units when a rapid increase in measles cases is reported in an area and local response capacity is limited or access is difficult. In 2022, MSF emergency teams in DRC vaccinated more than 2 million children in 14 provinces and treated over 37 000 patients with measles.

In addition to emergency interventions during outbreaks, our teams also provide logistical support for routine vaccination activities in health facilities in several provinces where our teams are present throughout the year.

But much greater efforts and investments are needed from the health authorities and their partners to increase immunisation coverage in DRC and stop the endless cycle of epidemics.

""The implementation of the 2nd dose in routine measles immunisation activities needs to be accelerated,"" says Dr Massing. ""This approach was recently adopted by the authorities and can make a real difference. Offering systematic catch-up vaccination activities during paediatric consultations in health facilities could also significantly help to increase the immunisation coverage in DRC.""

In the meantime, given the persistence of outbreaks in the country, which put more children at risk every day, it is essential to organise the mass catch-up vaccination campaigns that have been planned since the end of 2022 without delay throughout the country.

""Our teams are committed to continuing responding to measles flare-ups in DRC in support of the health authorities. But to do so, it is essential that enough emergency vaccines are available in the country,"" says Dr Massing.

""To date, 6 contacts from the flight have been contacted, and Public Health Service staff are working to rapidly contact an additional 29 contacts who were identified yesterday [21  Feb 2023],"" Rainger said.

""The focus is now on identifying any other passengers from this flight who may have travelled onwards to New Zealand.""

Once the contacts are identified, New Zealand Public Health Service staff will check immunity and implement appropriate public health actions, including vaccination.

The exposure event occurred on 15 Feb 2023, with signs and symptoms usually developing between 7 and 18 days after exposure.

""The free MMR vaccination is the best protection against measles, and the most important thing people can do to protect themselves is to ensure that they and their tamariki [children] are immunised.

People can call Healthline on 0800 611 116 for help and information.

A Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE) virus infection has been identified in the Riverina, the 1st NSW case of this mosquito season [2022-23] and the 1st confirmed transmission of the virus in the state since 2011.

The case is in a man in his 60s, who was potentially exposed to infected mosquitoes in the Temora Shire, Edward River Shire, or Murrumbidgee Council areas, which are areas of MVE concern. The infection was likely acquired in January 2023. The man has been admitted to hospital, where he continues to receive treatment.

Keira Glasgow, Director of NSW Health's One Health branch, said the case follows recent MVE detections in mosquitoes and sentinel chickens in parts of western and southern NSW where surveillance is being carried out.

""There is no vaccination or specific treatment for Murray Valley encephalitis, so we urge the community to do everything they can to protect themselves against mosquito bites,"" Ms Glasgow said.

""The best way to avoid infection is to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes, which are most active between dusk and dawn. Avoiding mosquito bites will also protect against other mosquito-borne infections including Japanese encephalitis, Kunjin, and Barmah Forest viruses.

""Only a small proportion of people infected with the virus will have any symptoms, which include fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhoea, and muscle aches.

""Signs of severe infection include severe headache, neck stiffness, sensitivity to bright lights, drowsiness, confusion, seizures, and loss of consciousness.""

Ms Glasgow said that the number of MVE detections in mosquitoes and sentinel chickens this season was concerning. In response, NSW Health has established an expert advisory panel on mosquito control and management with medical entomologists from across Australia.

""We are looking closely at the various approaches to mosquito control in different environments and in areas with different population densities to help inform our approach to mosquito control and management in NSW,"" Ms Glasgow said.

MVE virus is spread to humans by infected mosquitoes. Rarely, it causes severe neurological illness. The primary hosts of MVE and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) are wild waterbirds such as herons and egrets.

Protect yourself and your family from mosquito bites by:
- wearing light, loose-fitting long-sleeved shirts, long pants, and covered footwear and socks, especially around dusk and dawn;
- applying repellent to all areas of exposed skin, using repellents that contain DEET, picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus;
- re-applying repellent regularly, particularly after swimming, being sure to always apply sunscreen first and then apply repellent;
- covering openings such as windows and doors with insect screens and checking there are no gaps in them;
- removing items that might collect water (such as old tyres, empty pots) outside your house where mosquitoes can breed;
- improving drainage on your property so that water does not become stagnant;
- using insecticide sprays, vapour dispensing units, and mosquito coils to repel mosquitos (mosquito coils should only be used outside).

[This is the season for active Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE) virus. As the report above indicates, MVE virus has been found in mosquitoes in various areas of the state, and sentinel chickens have been positive. Now, there is the 1st human case in the state. So far this year (2023) there has been one human MVE case in Victoria and another in the Northern Territory. There is no vaccine for the virus, so avoiding mosquito bites is the only preventive measure available. One hopes that individuals living in areas at risk of MVE virus transmission will heed the preventive measures listed above. - Mod.TY

Ticks spread Balkan flu [Q fever], also known as cow fever. This is shown by the data of the National Center for Infectious and Parasitic Diseases (NCCPD).

Since the beginning of the year [2023], 7 cases of cow fever have been detected in [Bulgaria]. For comparison, during the same period last year [2022], not a single patient was registered. In addition to being bitten by a tick, Balkan flu can also be contracted from a sick animal -- a cow, goat, or sheep, ""Telegraf"" reports.

This can happen by inhaling sprays and dust containing the pathogen, or by consuming contaminated products. Whooping cough [?] brings symptoms that closely resemble the real flu -- headache, high fever, and muscle aches. A frequent complication is pneumonia.

The biggest outbreak in Bulgaria was registered at the end of 1992 in Panagyurishte [Pazardzhik Province, southern Bulgaria]. The disease began as an influenza epidemic with more than 2000 cases of acute respiratory illness, cough, and bronchopneumonia. A few years later, another wave was recorded in the same area. In 2004, another outbreak was registered in Botevgrad, affecting more than 200 people. Just 3 years ago, 14 positive samples were detected in 4 farms in Yambol. Other endemic areas are Ihtiman and Elin Pelin [Sofia Province], Stara Zagora, Blagoevgrad, Vratsa, and Varna [provinces].

According to experts, in order to protect ourselves from the Balkan flu [Q fever], we must not only be careful about tick bites, but also handle animal products with particular care, especially homemade milk, which should only be consumed after heat treatment.

ProMED Rapporteur Mahmoud Orabi

[Q fever is a zoonosis caused by _Coxiella burnetii_, an obligate intracellular rickettsia-like bacterium. The most common animal reservoirs of this organism are cattle, sheep, and goats. Infected animals excrete the bacterium in milk, urine, feces, and birth by-products, especially the placenta. Humans usually become infected by inhaling aerosolized organisms; intermittent high-level shedding occurs at the time of parturition, with millions of bacteria being released per gram of placenta. Consequently, Q fever is primarily an occupational hazard for farmers, veterinarians, and abattoir workers in contact with infected domestic animals, such as cattle, sheep, and goats. Ingestion of contaminated unpasteurized milk or milk products is a less common mode of transmission (<https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25692216/>).

However, _C. burnetii_ can be dispersed for a considerable distance in agricultural regions via airborne particles containing _C. burnetii_ to involve people living downwind from infected livestock. Widespread transmission of Q fever was documented in the Netherlands downwind from the index farm, a single dairy-goat farm, even beyond a 5 km (3 mi) high-risk zone (<https://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/55/12/1591.long#T2>).

_C. burnetii_ is highly resistant to drying, heat, and many common disinfectants, which is attributed to spore-like particles the organism forms in mammalian cells as part of a biphasic developmental cycle (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3949614/>). These features enable the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment.

Rarely, Q fever has been spread person-to-person through blood transfusion, from a pregnant woman to her fetus, through sex, infected breast milk, clustered familial cases, and nosocomial infection during delivery or autopsies (<https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/58/11/e146/2895430> and <https://www.cdc.gov/qfever/transmission/index.html>). In 2014, a Q fever outbreak occurred in Canadian and US travelers to Germany, where they received live sheep cell therapy (ProMED post 20170416.4974554).

Although ticks may readily transmit _C. burnetii_ in experimental systems (<https://parasitesandvectors.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13071-020-3956-z>) and may transmit _C. burnetii_ among wildlife species and livestock (<https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2022.1068129/full>), their role as vectors of _C. burnetii_ in humans is still controversial (<https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26458781/>).

Although often asymptomatic, the infection can present acutely 2-3 weeks after exposure as atypical pneumonia or hepatitis or as a chronic disease (mainly endocarditis/endarteritis) (<http://cmr.asm.org/content/12/4/518.short>). The patients at highest risk for chronic Q fever are those with pre-existing valvular heart disease, a vascular graft, or an arterial aneurysm and pregnancy (<https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6203a1.htm>). Unusual complications include glomerulonephritis and rhabdomyolysis (<http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08860220701460178>). Post-Q fever fatigue syndrome has been reported in up to 20% of patients with acute Q fever.

During pregnancy, Q fever may result in obstetric complications, such as placental infection, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine growth retardation, intrauterine fetal death, premature delivery, and maternal chronic Q fever (<https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/45/5/548/273863>).

Diagnosis of Q fever can usually be confirmed by serology (<https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/qfever/>). In acute Q fever, phase II antibodies are usually much higher than phase I antibodies and are detectable by indirect immunofluorescence 2 to 3 weeks after onset of illness. In chronic Q fever, phase I antibody titers are much greater than phase II titers. Phase I antibody titers of 1:800 or higher are considered diagnostic in endocarditis patients for chronic Q fever.

Tetracyclines are considered the antibiotics of choice for treatment of acute Q fever. Q fever endocarditis is treated with the combination of doxycycline plus hydroxychloroquine for at least 18 months (<https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/414865>).

A human vaccine for Q fever is used in Australia, but it is not available in the United States. In Australia, Q fever vaccination is recommended for those working in ""at-risk"" occupations such as abattoir workers, farmers, stockyard workers, shearers, animal transporters, and others exposed to cattle, camels, sheep, goats, and kangaroos or their products (including products of conception), veterinarians, veterinary nurses, veterinary students, professional dog and cat breeders, agricultural college staff and students, wildlife and zoo workers (working with high-risk animals), and laboratory personnel handling veterinary specimens or working with the organism (<https://immunisationhandbook.health.gov.au/vaccine-preventable-diseases/q-fever>). - Mod.ML

In Australia, Q fever vaccination is recommended for those working in ""at-risk"" occupations such as abattoir workers, farmers, stockyard workers, shearers, animal transporters, and others exposed to cattle, camels, sheep, goats, and kangaroos or their products (including products of conception), veterinarians, veterinary nurses, veterinary students, professional dog and cat breeders, agricultural college staff and students, wildlife and zoo workers (working with high-risk animals), and laboratory personnel handling veterinary specimens or working with the organism (<https://immunisationhandbook.health.gov.au/vaccine-preventable-diseases/q-fever>). - Mod.MLProMED map:Bulgaria: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8708555,81>]",Plovdiv24,,

Since the beginning of the year [2023], 2 people have died from visceral leishmaniasis in Rondonópolis, 218 km [135.5 mi] from Cuiabá, according to the Municipal Health Secretariat. A 3rd death is being investigated. The 2 victims are men, one 54 years old, resident of the municipality, and the other 52 years old, from Nova Brasilândia, 223 km [138.6 mi] from the capital.

Regarding the 3rd case, the secretariat reported that the patient, aged 32, lived in Vila Paulista and died last week [week of 13 Feb 2023]. The Municipal Regional Hospital is taking care of the body and should issue a report on the cause of death within 10 days.

According to the secretary, the city is considered endemic for the disease, which means that it can affect the entire population of the region.

[According to WHO figures, Brazil accounts for 96% of all cases of human visceral leishmaniasis (HVL) in the Americas. Domestic dogs are the main animal reservoir in both urban and rural areas, with up to 20% of dogs infected with canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) in highly endemic localities. HVL occurs in all regions of Brazil, and in recent decades autochthonous cases have trended from rural to urban areas, due at least in part to the increasing urbanization of sandfly vectors of the disease. Control measures applied against the vectors and the canine reservoirs have shown only limited success [ref.1].

Mato Grosso has experienced a significant rise in cases of HVL since 1998. Although _Lutzomyia longipalpis_ is the dominant vector of _Leishmania_ parasites in Brazil, _L. cruzi_ has also been implicated in both HVL and CVL in Mato Grosso [ref.2]. The adjoining state of Mato Grosso do Sul has areas of intense _Leishmania_ transmission and has been the subject of a recent comprehensive spatiotemporal study of disease distribution [ref.3].

Rondonópolis is a rapidly growing city in southern Mato Grosso, and should not be confused with the Rondônia, the state that borders Mato Grosso on the west. Both are named after Cândido Rondon, a Brazilian army engineer famous for his explorations of Mato Grosso, the Western Amazon Basin, and the self-named River of Doubt (the latter with the American ex-President Theodore Roosevelt). Rondonópolis is a jumping-off point for the Pantanal, the world's largest tropical wetland area, which extends from Mato Grosso into Mato Grosso do Sul. The Pantanal has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site on account of its spectacular plant and animal diversity. Because the region has great tourism potential, an epidemiologic survey of leishmaniasis has been conducted for all of its municipalities. Between 2007 and 2016, there were 10 cases of HVL and 499 cases of human cutaneous leishmaniasis in the Pantanal region of Mato Grosso. Sandfly vectors and canine reservoirs of _Leishmania_ were also found in most of the municipalities [ref.4].

Syphilis was nearly eradicated around 2000, but in the past few years, Oklahoma has seen a huge rise in cases, including in pregnant mothers. Cases of congenital syphilis have increased from single digits [3 cases in 2016] to 85 [in 2022 (<https://www.news9.com/story/63f39af2435f0508a2ffa528/local-health-experts-hope-proposed-bill-could-combat-prenatal-syphilis-problem>)].

""From 2016 to 2021 we saw a significant increase,"" Amber Marr with the Carter County Health Department said. ""In 2016 we were looking at about 264, and in 2021 those numbers went to over 1200 [cases of primary and secondary syphilis (<https://www.oklahoman.com/story/news/healthcare/2022/10/29/syphilis-cases-increasing-in-oklahoma-heres-what-to-know-about-it/69572043007/>)]"".

Marr said it's difficult to know what exactly is leading to the increase in cases of syphilis in Oklahoma, but there are a few factors that increase patients' risk. ""I could relate it to maybe online dating, the ease of finding partners,"" Marr said. ""The increase of drug use or sex for drugs or money, things like that.""

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease that damages your brain, nerves, and other organs. Since it's caused by a bacteria called _Treponema pallidum_, it's pretty easy to treat. Just a few shots of penicillin will clear many patients up. But the rise of cases in Oklahoma is worrisome because if a pregnant woman has syphilis, it can be deadly for her baby.

""Long-term complications in the pregnant mom or the baby are significant,"" Marr said. ""It can lead to blindness deafness seizures, and stillbirth. So they can be pretty extreme.""

Right now in Oklahoma, expectant mothers are tested once for syphilis, but a senate bill introduced this session would add 2 more required tests -- between 28 weeks and 32 weeks and at birth. Marr said this could be life-changing.

""Post delivery, if that was the earliest you were tested, there will be significant testing on the baby and then treatment,"" Marr said. ""Treatments for babies differ depending on the severity but either IV medication or intramuscular medication.""

The Carter County Health Department recently received a grant for a rapid syphilis test, so it's even easier to screen people who may have the disease. They encourage everyone who is sexually active to get tested. And you can get tested confidentially, for free for syphilis and all STDs [sexually transmitted diseases] at the health department.

[Trends in the number of congenital syphilis cases reflect rates of primary & secondary (P&S) syphilis among reproductive aged women. Since 2013, the rate of congenital syphilis has increased each year. In 2014, the incidence rate of reported congenital syphilis cases in the US was 11.6 cases per 100 000 live births (<https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6444a3.htm>). By 2020, the national congenital syphilis rate of 57.3 cases per 100 000 live births represents a 394% increase relative to 2014 (<https://www.cdc.gov/std/statistics/2020/overview.htm>).

In a CDC study of about 1300 cases of congenital syphilis reported nationwide in 2018, ""missed opportunities"" for prevention of congenital syphilis occurred, which varied by region (<https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6922a1.htm>). Racial/ethnic disparities existed within the highest morbidity regions: in the South, the most commonly missed prevention opportunity among white mothers of infants with congenital syphilis was no timely prenatal care and no timely syphilis testing (31.6%), whereas, among black and Hispanic mothers, no adequate maternal treatment despite a timely syphilis diagnosis (37%) was the commonest. These differences in missed prevention opportunities require strategies that are tailored to local situations.

The US states with rates of congenital syphilis above the national average in 2019 (48.5 cases per 100 000 live births) were in the South and Southwest, including Texas (138.2), Arizona (133.1), New Mexico (117.8), Nevada (114.7), Louisiana (111.4), California (94.3), Oklahoma (85.6), Florida (64.8), and Arkansas (56.0); in 2019, Oklahoma had 43 cases of congenital syphilis in newborns (<https://www.cdc.gov/std/statistics/2019/std-surveillance-2019.pdf> Table 40). In 2022, there were 85 cases in the state.

Poverty and other social determinants have a big impact on rates of syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases among women. Public health authorities in Oklahoma postulate online dating, illicit drug use or sex for drugs or money may be such determinants. More specific information on factors driving this increase in syphilis in Oklahoma would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

Carter County (pop., 47 557 in 2010) is located in the south-central portion of the US state of Oklahoma; about 12.70% of families and 16.60% of the population were below the poverty line (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carter_County,_Oklahoma>).

An 11-year-old girl from southeast Cambodia's Prey Veng province died of H5N1 human avian influenza, the Ministry of Health's Communicable Disease Control Department said Wednesday [22 Feb 2023].

The girl fell ill on 16 Feb 2023, with the symptoms of a high temperature of 39 deg C [102.2 deg F], cough, and sore throat, the department said in a news release, adding that she first sought local health service, but her condition had worsened, having rapid breathing, so she was then transferred to the National Pediatric Hospital in Phnom Penh.

""On 21 Feb 2023, the doctor took her samples for diagnosis at the National Institute of Public Health, and the results came out on 22 Feb 2023, confirming that she was positive for H5N1 bird flu, while the girl died,"" the news release said.

The news release called on people not to touch ill or dead poultry, and if suspected of having been infected with the virus, they should consult with doctors or make a hotline call to 115.

H5N1 influenza is a flu that normally spreads between sick poultry, but it can sometimes spread from poultry to humans, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

The WHO said from 2003 until 2014, there were 56 cases of infected humans and 37 people died in Cambodia. However, between 2015 and 2022, no humans were infected by the virus in the country.

The Ministry of Health has confirmed that an 11-year-old girl died from the highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) yesterday [22 Feb 2023]

The case of the deadly virus took place in Roleang village, Romlech commune, Sithor Kandal district, Prey Veng province.

Ms Youk Sambath, Secretary of State of the Ministry of Health, stated that the girl started to get sick on 16 Feb 2023 with symptoms of a fever of 39 deg Celsius [102.2 deg F], a cough, and sore throat.

After 3 days of unrelenting treatment, the girl began to feel tired and was sent to the National Children's Hospital in Phnom Penh for treatment.

Ms Youk Sambath continued that on 21 Feb 2023, the doctor took a sample to the National Institute of Public Health and received the result on 22 Feb 2023, the same day that the girl was pronounced dead.

Ms Youk Sambath said that, according to sources from the villagers, there was an abnormal death of wild animals in the village.

After the incident, veterinarians took samples on 17 Feb 2023 and are waiting for the results from the veterinary laboratory.

Ms Youk Sambath continued that, after finding out about the case of bird flu, the Ministry of Health's emergency response team worked closely with the veterinary team to investigate and find the source of both animal and human infections and to find suspected cases and people in order to prevent transmission to others, both in the community and in ceremonies.

In addition, the emergency response team took action to educate the people.

Ms Youk Sambath called on the villagers to pay close attention to health, especially not to eat dead animals.

Influenza A virus subtype H5N1 (A/H5N1) is a subtype of the influenza A virus that can cause illness in humans and many other animal species.

A bird-adapted strain of H5N1, called HPAI A(H5N1) for highly pathogenic avian influenza virus of type A of subtype H5N1, is the highly pathogenic causative agent of H5N1 flu, commonly known as avian influenza (""bird flu"").

It is enzootic (maintained in the population) in many bird populations, especially in Southeast Asia.

[ProMED thanks Sonny Krishnan and another reader who wished to remain anonymous for their submissions on this topic. Although no cases of H5N1 in humans have been reported in Cambodia since 2014, there was a case of H9N2 picked up by routine surveillance in a 3-year-old child in 2021 (see ProMED post 20210919.8668826). The child in that case had exposure to poultry with H9N2 viruses known to be endemic in the poultry population in Cambodia.

At a ranch in Valle de Trinidad kept in quarantine since October of last year [2022], the Baja California State Committee for the Promotion and Protection of Livestock, dependent on the State Secretariat of the Countryside, sampled the company's sheep herd Baja Dorper, one of the specimens testing positive for _Brucella melitensis_, which led to the ranch being placed in quarantine, informed the general director, Edgar Hernández Núñez.

He explained that _Brucella melitensis_ is a bacterium having not been detected in Baja California in the last 20 years, which represents a serious health risk.

He added, _Brucella melitensis_ is ""facultative intracellular,"" meaning the bacteria hides in the cells and can go unnoticed in various tests. Therefore, a sheep herd can be sampled today, come out negative, but 2 months later, some of the sheep can appear positive.

""This is the uncertainty that should not be allowed, because there were failures in the procedure and fraud in the committee's actions, generating patrimonial and moral damage. This worries us, but we fully trust that he state government, through the SADER-BC secretary, will take forceful action as soon as possible, because we have been unable to work for many months, and we continue with the same herd as according to the committee presented an exemplary reactor,"" he said.

Hernández Núñez said that he has met with the secretary of the Campo, and the situation has been explained to him in detail, since the actions of the State Committee for the Promotion and Protection of Livestock, the serious problems the company has faced as a result of the quarantine and the perception generated from them.

He pointed out they hope before the end of this month [February 2023], a path will have been decided upon to close this chapter, document it perfectly well to avoid repetition, and be able to advance in the Baja Dorper genetic innovation project.

[""_Brucella melitensis_ infection in certain breeds of sheep causes clinical disease similar to that in goats. However, _B. ovis_ produces a disease unique to sheep, in which epididymitis and orchitis impair fertility, the principal economic effect. Occasionally, placentitis and abortion are seen, and there may be perinatal mortality. The disease was first described in New Zealand and Australia and has since been reported from many sheep-raising areas of the world. _B. ovis_ infection among sheep in the USA is rare.

""There is no evidence the disease is present in any other animal species. Rare, natural, and experimental infections in farmed red deer stags have been reported in New Zealand.

""Rams as young as 8 weeks have been infected experimentally by various nonvenereal routes. The disease can be transmitted among rams by direct contact. Active infection in ewes is unusual but has developed after mating with naturally infected rams. Contaminated pastures do not appear to be important in spread of the disease. Infection frequently persists in rams, and a high percentage shed _B. ovis_ intermittently for several years.

""Primary manifestations are lesions of the epididymis, tunica, and testis in rams; placentitis and abortion in ewes; and occasionally perinatal death in lambs. Lesions may develop rapidly. In rams, the first detectable abnormality may be a marked deterioration in semen quality associated with the presence of inflammatory cells and organisms. An acute systemic phase is rarely seen in naturally occurring infections. After regression of the acute phase -- which may be so mild as to go unobserved -- lesions may be palpated in the epididymis and scrotal tunics. Epididymal enlargement may be unilateral or bilateral. The tail of the epididymis is involved more frequently than the head or body, and the most prominent lesion is spermatoceles of variable size containing partially inspissated spermatic fluid. The tunics frequently become thickened and fibrous, and extensive adhesions develop between them. The testes may show fibrous atrophy; these lesions are usually permanent. In a few cases, palpable lesions are transient, while in others, organisms may be present in semen over long periods without clinically detectable lesions.

""Because not all infected rams show palpable abnormalities of scrotal tissues (and not all cases of epididymitis are due to brucellosis), the remaining rams must be examined further. Rams shedding organisms, but having no lesions, must be identified by culture of semen. Repeated examinations may be necessary to identify intermittent shedders. Microscopic examination of stained semen smears may also be helpful; fluorescent antibody examination is a highly specific diagnostic aid. Serologic tests used for eradication of disease and certification of animals include indirect ELISA, complement fixation, hemagglutination inhibition, indirect agglutination, and gel diffusion. Incidence and spread of the disease may be reduced by regular examination of rams before the breeding season and culling of those with obvious genital abnormalities. Because susceptibility in rams increases markedly with age, it is advantageous to keep a young ram flock and isolate noninfected rams from older, possibly infected rams.

""Immunization of weaner rams with attenuated _B. melitensis_ has been recommended in some countries. Because infection in ewes apparently originates almost exclusively from service by infected rams, lamb losses through infection of ewes may be controlled economically by restricting vaccination to rams.

""Chlortetracycline and streptomycin used concurrently have effected bacteriologic cures. However, treatment is not economic except in especially valuable rams, and even if infection is eliminated, fertility may remain impaired.""

In France, _Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus_ (_Begomovirus_, ToLCNDV - EPPO A2 List) was first found in 2020 on _Cucurbita pepo_ (zucchini) [ProMED post 20201029.7898960] and later declared eradicated (EPPO RS 2020/250, RS 2021/119). The NPPO (National Plant Protection Organisation) of France recently informed EPPO of new detections of ToLCNDV on its territory. The virus was detected in 5 locations in Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region in September and October 2022:

- in 3 companies producing and trading seeds of _C. pepo_, _Cucumis sativus_ (cucumber) and _Cucumis melo_ (melon). Phytosanitary measures were implemented (destruction and incineration of plants, treatments against the virus vector, _Bemisia tabaci_);

- in 2 sites for fruit production of _C. pepo_ (1 ha outdoor plot and a 640 m² growing tunnel). All plants in the affected plots were uprooted and destroyed after harvest. In 2023, the growers will have to carry out crop rotation and apply treatments against the vector.

[_Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus_ (ToLCNDV; genus _Begomovirus_) was first identified as causing severe yield losses on tomato and watermelon crops on the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the tomato leaf curl and yellow leaf curl clades of the genus. Known species in these clades cause similar diseases on solanaceous and other hosts and are considered to be the biggest constraint to solanaceous and cucurbit crops, both in terms of yield losses (up to 100% in tomato) and loss of fruit quality.

Begomoviruses are transmitted by different whitefly vectors (such as _Bemisia tabaci_ biotypes). Many can also be transmitted by mechanical means and grafting; they are generally not considered to be capable of true seed transmission (i.e., via the embryo). Whiteflies in themselves are serious pests of many vegetable crops. If virus sources are available locally, high vector numbers are often reflected in high levels of the viral diseases they transmit. Begomovirus control is particularly difficult in open field crops due to the widespread presence and wide host range of whiteflies. Disease management may include pathogen exclusion, vector control, as well as elimination of possible pathogen and/or vector reservoirs. In some cases, crop cultivars with increased virus resistance are available.

ToLCNDV was limited to Asia until it was reported from Europe for the 1st time in 2013 on cucurbits in Spain (ProMED post 20131223.2131729). It has since also been reported from several other countries in the Mediterranean region. Severe potato leaf curl disease caused by a ToLCNDV is currently emerging as a global threat.

Novel viruses have been shown to emerge from recombination events during co-infections of ToLCNDV and other begomoviruses (see links below).The recombinant viruses are often more aggressive and have a widened host range, compared to each of the partners. Examples are new viruses identified in the Mediterranean region causing severe damage to cucurbit crops but poorly infecting tomatoes; or the new potato strain of ToLCNDV having acquired an extraneous betasatellite (small circular DNA in addition to the viral genome), which is considered responsible for its host preference and severity of symptoms. Such new hybrid viruses pose an increased risk to solanaceous, cucurbit, and potentially other crops worldwide.

For the report above, it is not clear if a source of the new detections is being investigated. Both new incursions with plant material or via infectious insects, and reinfection from local plant reservoirs would be possible, since eradication of established pathogens has rarely been successful anywhere in the past (see ProMED post 20230105.8707630 and multiple previous ProMED posts in the archives).

.................................................dha/tw/mpp","In France, _Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus_ (_Begomovirus_, ToLCNDV - EPPO A2 List) was first found in 2020 on _Cucurbita pepo_ (zucchini) [ProMED post 20201029.7898960] and later declared eradicated (EPPO RS 2020/250, RS 2021/119). The NPPO (National Plant Protection Organisation) of France recently informed EPPO of new detections of ToLCNDV on its territory. The virus was detected in 5 locations in Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region in September and October 2022:- in 3 companies producing and trading seeds of _C. pepo_, _Cucumis sativus_ (cucumber) and _Cucumis melo_ (melon). Phytosanitary measures were implemented (destruction and incineration of plants, treatments against the virus vector, _Bemisia tabaci_);- in 2 sites for fruit production of _C. pepo_ (1 ha outdoor plot and a 640 m² growing tunnel). All plants in the affected plots were uprooted and destroyed after harvest. In 2023, the growers will have to carry out crop rotation and apply treatments against the vector.--Communicated by:ProMED[_Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus_ (ToLCNDV; genus _Begomovirus_) was first identified as causing severe yield losses on tomato and watermelon crops on the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the tomato leaf curl and yellow leaf curl clades of the genus. Known species in these clades cause similar diseases on solanaceous and other hosts and are considered to be the biggest constraint to solanaceous and cucurbit crops, both in terms of yield losses (up to 100% in tomato) and loss of fruit quality.Begomoviruses are transmitted by different whitefly vectors (such as _Bemisia tabaci_ biotypes). Many can also be transmitted by mechanical means and grafting; they are generally not considered to be capable of true seed transmission (i.e., via the embryo). Whiteflies in themselves are serious pests of many vegetable crops. If virus sources are available locally, high vector numbers are often reflected in high levels of the viral diseases they transmit. Begomovirus control is particularly difficult in open field crops due to the widespread presence and wide host range of whiteflies. Disease management may include pathogen exclusion, vector control, as well as elimination of possible pathogen and/or vector reservoirs. In some cases, crop cultivars with increased virus resistance are available.ToLCNDV was limited to Asia until it was reported from Europe for the 1st time in 2013 on cucurbits in Spain (ProMED post 20131223.2131729). It has since also been reported from several other countries in the Mediterranean region. Severe potato leaf curl disease caused by a ToLCNDV is currently emerging as a global threat.Novel viruses have been shown to emerge from recombination events during co-infections of ToLCNDV and other begomoviruses (see links below).The recombinant viruses are often more aggressive and have a widened host range, compared to each of the partners. Examples are new viruses identified in the Mediterranean region causing severe damage to cucurbit crops but poorly infecting tomatoes; or the new potato strain of ToLCNDV having acquired an extraneous betasatellite (small circular DNA in addition to the viral genome), which is considered responsible for its host preference and severity of symptoms. Such new hybrid viruses pose an increased risk to solanaceous, cucurbit, and potentially other crops worldwide.For the report above, it is not clear if a source of the new detections is being investigated. Both new incursions with plant material or via infectious insects, and reinfection from local plant reservoirs would be possible, since eradication of established pathogens has rarely been successful anywhere in the past (see ProMED post 20230105.8707630 and multiple previous ProMED posts in the archives).MapsFrance (with regions):<https://www.worldometers.info/img/maps/france_physical_map.gif>Europe, overview:<https://mapofeurope.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/europe-political-map.jpg>PicturesLeaf curl disease on tomato:<https://www.agric.wa.gov.au/sites/gateway/files/TYLCV%203%20bush.jpg>,<https://c8.alamy.com/comp/ACGAME/tomato-yellow-leaf-curl-virus-symptoms-on-tomato-leaves-on-plants-ACGAME.jpg>,<https://www.plantmanagementnetwork.org/pub/php/research/2008/TYLCV/image/TYLCV2.jpg> and<https://vegcropshotline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_20180616_103634.jpg>ToLCNDV symptoms:<http://cienciacebas.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/aranda-1.jpg> (zucchini) and<http://cienciacebas.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/aranda-2.jpg> (cucumber and melon)Photo gallery of symptoms of different begomoviruses:<http://www.forestryimages.org/browse/TaxImages.cfm?fam=651&genus=Begomovirus>Whiteflies:<https://www.planetnatural.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/whitefly.jpg> and<https://www.pinpointpestcontrol.com/images/whitefly-on-plant.jpg>LinksInformation on ToLCNDV:<https://gd.eppo.int/taxon/TOLCND> (with distribution),<https://doi.org/10.1079/cabicompendium.118179>,<https://doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2020.6179>,<https://doi.org/10.1111/ppa.12978>,<https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.00140>,<https://doi.org/10.1007/s41348-021-00463-w> (potato strain) and<https://doi.org/10.3390/v9100264> (review)Novel ToLCNDV recombinant viruses:<https://doi.org/10.3390/v8110307> and<https://doi.org/10.1007/s10327-019-00849-7>Information on viral betasatellites:<https://doi.org/10.1007/s11262-019-01716-5>,<https://viralzone.expasy.org/7777>,<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/GenomesGroup.cgi?taxid=190729> and via<https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/betasatellite>Information on leaf curl viral diseases on different hosts:<http://www.oisat.org/pests/diseases/viral/leaf_curl__virus.html> and via<https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/tomato-leaf-curl-virus>Virus ans betasatellite taxonomy via:<https://ictv.global/taxonomy>_B. tabaci_ whiteflies, taxonomy, and biotypes:<http://www.iucngisd.org/gisd/species.php?sc=106> (with pictures)EPPO A2 list:<https://www.eppo.int/ACTIVITIES/plant_quarantine/A2_list>- Mod.DHA]",European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO) Reporting Service 01/2023/021,,

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) on a mink farm in Spain remains unexplained but there was ""probably"" some mammal-to-mammal transmission involved, one of the UK's most senior animal health experts has said.

Ian Brown, director of scientific services at the APHA [Animal and Plant Health Agency - UK] spoke to Vet Record following news that more than 50 000 mink on the farm in Galicia had to be culled as part of a ""stamping out"" strategy to deal with an outbreak of HPAI of a type belonging to the H5N1 group.

The outbreak occurred in October 2022, but a ""rapid communication"" about it did not appear in the infectious disease journal Eurosurveillance until January this year [2023] [ProMED post 20230122.8707905; see comment]. Shortly after publication, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that, while the risk to people was low, it was working out contingency plans and was in talks with vaccine manufacturers because of the human pandemic potential of H5N1.

The APHA recently confirmed it had found cases of HPAI H5N1 in several mammals, including foxes [see item 4] and otters, with the assumption being that these wild animals became infected through scavenging on dead or dying birds. It has also been recently confirmed that 4 seal carcases found in Scotland in late 2021/early 2022, which were sent to the APHA for screening, were positive for H5N1, according to the Scottish Marine Animal Strandings Scheme. Meanwhile, infection in sea lions in Peru has been confirmed, with scientists linking the virus to a mass die-off of over 500 sea lions.

Brown is the government's lead on avian influenza outbreak preparedness in the UK. He said the virus appeared to have changed in recent months in ways that gave rise to concern, explaining: ""There are a number of things happening that are telling us that this virus is very, very efficient. It's now in the Americas and it's down into South America, and there are things happening there that are a concern.

""As the virus gets into other parts of the world where probably they're less experienced at dealing with it, how good is the surveillance and monitoring? And if it were to spill over into other populations, would they pick it up?"" However, he said information from the WHO and World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH, formerly OIE) had helped prompt awareness.

On the infection pathway at play in the mink farm outbreak, he said there were ""several possible explanations.""

""It could have been contaminated raw meat products, although I think that's less likely,"" he said. ""I believe the Spanish have excluded that. It could be that there are wild birds that have had access."" He added that it was ""not 100%"" clear whether there had been mink-to-mink transmission but said: ""We think that because of the number of animals that got infected, it probably had got from one mink cage to another.""

Vet Record asked Brown whether the APHA had concerns about the possible role that rodent infestations on some UK poultry farms could be playing in outbreaks in the UK. He replied: ""We are completely aware of the rodent issue. We haven't got direct evidence that rodents themselves get infected and shed virus. It's fair to say that mice are used in some laboratories as an animal to study responses [to the virus], but there's not really been any definitive work that says they harbour it and spread it among each other.

""We know rodents can access poultry houses. That's quite common, and there's rodent control. So, what's probably more likely is, where you've got an infestation, these animals forage in an environment around the farm, and that environment is also a touchpoint for wild birds that shed the virus in their faeces. So these rodents are in an environment common with wild birds.

""They can actually carry the virus in on their fur, so fomite transmission is, I think, highly plausible.

""I'm not saying the rodents are taking it in, but they've got to be a factor. Not all farms have rodent problems -- let's be clear about that -- but some do... I think this mechanical fomite transmission is something that's highly probable. We haven't got definitive evidence, but we are doing work to try and understand this.""

Currently the APHA has not found cases of rats and mice being infected with HPAI. On wildlife cases, Brown said the possibility of the virus going from fox to fox or otter to otter could not be ruled out ""absolutely"" but added: ""We've got no evidence at the moment from our surveillance that it is maintaining in those mammalian populations.""

[The Eurosurveillance's rapid communication on the mink outbreak in Spain, published 19 Jan 2023, included the following abstract:

""In October 2022, an outbreak in Europe of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) in intensively farmed minks occurred in north west Spain. A single mink farm hosting more than 50 000 minks was involved. The identified viruses belong to clade 2.3.4.4b, which is responsible of the ongoing epizootic in Europe. An uncommon mutation (T271A) in the PB2 gene with potential public health implications was found. Our investigations indicate onward mink transmission of the virus may have occurred on the affected farm.""

A letter to the editor followed, addressing the said communication, published on 16 Feb 2023. It concluded: ""Disruption of the 2SBS in H5N1 viruses in minks is thus far an unreported feature that they have in common with human-adapted influenza A viruses. Loss of the 2SBS may drive selection for changes in the receptor binding properties of HA, possibly resulting in increased binding to human-type receptors. Such changes in HA are expected to promote replication and transmission in mammalian hosts, including humans. Preservation or loss of the 2SBS is likely a viral host range determinant and could be an early adaptation signal that should be included in analysis of the pandemic potential of emerging IAVs.""

In their response, published on the same issue of Eurosurveillance, the authors underlined the importance of carefully analysing whole-genome sequences and vigilantly monitoring virus evolution in each host, whether domestic or wild. ""Any country that notifies an outbreak should ideally have access to sequencing and data-sharing mechanisms. Genomic surveillance is crucial to quickly identify any virus with zoonotic potential that could pose a threat to animal and public health.""

[2] H5N1 in mammals - mink, zoonotic significance assessed
Date: Wed 8 Feb 2023
Source: JAMA [abridged, edited]
<https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2801499#:~:text=In%20April%202022%2C%20a%20dead,in%20a%20mammal%20in%20Japan>


As bird flu continues to circle the globe, a recent report suggests that the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus spread between farmed mink in Spain last October [2022]. The virus also may have been transmitted between seals in coastal New England last summer.

The events mark the 1st large H5N1 outbreaks potentially driven by mammal-to-mammal transmission. The outbreaks, along with the virus' ongoing transmission in wild birds and poultry and increasing infections in wild mammals, have renewed concerns that H5N1, first identified in the mid-1990s, could be poised for spillover into humans.

The ongoing avian influenza outbreak is now the largest on record in Europe and North America, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The outbreak is being driven by H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b viruses, which emerged in the Netherlands in October 2020 before spreading through Europe, Asia, and Africa. A recent report by the European Food Safety Authority and other agencies found that since October 2021, more than 58 million birds have died or been culled in H5N1-affected poultry establishments in 37 European countries. By December 2021, bird flu had arrived in North America. Within a year, wild bird outbreaks were confirmed in 47 US states, according to a recent epidemiological alert from the Pan American Health Organization. Nearly 60 million birds in commercial and backyard flocks in 47 US states have died or been culled, the US Department of Agriculture reported in early February [2023].

The virus has been detected in ducks, geese, gulls, pelicans, swans, vultures, crows, owls, eagles, and many other species of wild birds. With so many birds affected, the opportunities for exposure to other animals have been high. In addition to minks and seals, the list of mammals with confirmed infections in Europe and the Americas has now includes badger, black bear, bobcat, coyote, dolphin, ferret, fisher cat, fox [see item 4], leopard, lynx, opossum, otter, pig, polecat, porpoise, raccoon, raccoon dog, and skunk.

Martin Beer, DVM, who heads the Institute of Diagnostic Virology within the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, the Federal Research Institute for Animal Health, in Germany, said the mink farm outbreak requires special attention and awareness.

""[T]he likely animal-to-animal spread connected with clinical signs and mortality is significant, since spread between mammals might allow for further adaptation to the mammalian host,"" he wrote in an email to JAMA.

Although no human infections were reported on the mink facility, the incident indicates that the virus has the potential to spread in this intensively farmed species, said Isabella Monne, DVM, PhD, head of the viral genomics and transcriptomics laboratory at the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie, the Italian public health institute that characterized the viruses identified in the outbreak, described in Eurosurveillance [ProMED post 20230122.8707905]. Monne warned in an email that the ""increasing genetic diversity and geographical distribution of HPAI H5N1 viruses may result in more spillover events in mammals, posing great risks not only to the poultry industry but also to wildlife conservation and to human health.""

Avian influenza viruses are classified as ""highly pathogenic"" or ""low pathogenicity"" based on their effects in birds, not necessarily in other animals. Although the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus has caused sporadic human infections since it was first detected in waterfowl in China in 1996, it doesn't spread easily between people and other mammals. Increasing mammalian infections raise the stakes, said Amesh Adalja,MD, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. ""Lots of flu viruses circulate in birds but never pose major threats to humans,"" Adalja said in an interview. ""When you think about the steps that are related to the emergence of a new human influenza threat, the ability to infect mammalian species is one of those steps.""

[3] H5N1 in mammals - mink, zoonotic significance assessed
Date: Sun 19 Feb 2023
Source: KSL Broadcasting via Associated Press [edited]
<https://www.ksl.com/article/50582530/why-sick-minks-are-reigniting-worries-about-bird-flu>


A recent bird flu outbreak at a mink farm has reignited worries about the virus spreading more broadly to people. Scientists have been keeping tabs on this bird flu virus since the 1950s, though it wasn't deemed a threat to people until a 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong among visitors to live poultry markets. As bird flu hits more and varied animals, like at the mink farm, the fear is that the virus could evolve to spread more easily between people, and potentially trigger a pandemic.

Scientists say another kind of bird flu was likely behind the devastating 1918-1919 flu pandemic, and avian viruses played roles in other flu pandemics in 1957, 1968, and 2009.

Still, the risk to the general public now is low, says Dr. Tim Uyeki of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

A look at the bird flu virus and why it is getting renewed attention:

What is bird flu?

Some flu viruses mainly affect people, but some others chiefly occur in animals. For example, there are cases of flu that occur in dogs, plus pig -- or swine -- flu viruses. And then there are avian viruses that spread naturally in wild aquatic birds like ducks and geese, and then to chickens and other domesticated poultry.

The bird flu virus drawing attention today -- Type A H5N1 -- was first identified in 1959, by investigators looking into a flu outbreak in chickens in Scotland. Like other viruses, it has evolved over time, spawning newer versions of itself.

By 2007, the virus was found in more than 60 countries. In the US, it has recently been detected in wild birds in every state, as well as in commercial poultry operations or backyard flocks in 47 states. Since the beginning of last year, [2022] tens of millions of chickens have died of the virus or been killed to stop outbreaks from spreading, one of the reasons cited for soaring egg prices.

How often do people get bird flu?

The Hong Kong outbreak in 1997 was the 1st time this bird flu was blamed for severe human illness. Out of 18 people infected, 6 died. To contain the outbreak, the Hong Kong government closed live poultry markets, killed all the birds in the markets, and stopped bringing in chickens from southern China. It worked, for a while.

Symptoms are similar to that of other cases of flu, including cough, body aches and fever. Some people don't have noticeable symptoms, but some develop severe. life-threatening pneumonia.

Globally, nearly 870 human infections and 457 deaths have been reported to the World Health Organization in 20 countries. But the pace has slowed, and there have been about 170 infections and 50 deaths in the last 7 years. In the vast majority of cases, the infected people got it directly from infected birds.

The 1st and only US case occurred just last April [2022]. A prison inmate in a work program picked it up while killing infected birds at a poultry farm in Montrose County, Colorado, in the western part of the state. His only symptom was fatigue, and he recovered.

Can it spread between people?

In some instances, investigators concluded that the bird flu virus apparently did spread from one person to another. That happened in Thailand, Viet Nam, Indonesia, China, and Pakistan, most recently in 2007.

In each cluster, it spread within families from a sick person in the home. Scientists do not believe it can spread easily through casual contact, as seasonal flu can. But viruses mutate and change. Scientists worry about the ever-increasing number of opportunities for bird flu to mix with other flu viruses in infected people or animals and mutate, making it easier to spread to people.

It wouldn't take much for that to happen ""and then we would be in a really tough situation,"" said Dr. Luis Ostrosky, chief of infectious diseases and epidemiology at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston.

The CDC's Uyeki said the most worried he's been about H5N1 was during the earlier clusters. That kind of human-to-human spread does not appear to be happening right now, he said.

What happened at the mink farm?

Recent concern among public health experts has been fueled, in part, by detection of infections in a variety of mammals. The growing list includes foxes, raccoons, skunks, bears, and even marine mammals like seals and porpoises. Officials in Peru said 3 sea lions found dead in November [2022] tested positive, and the recent deaths of hundreds of others may be due to bird flu.

Then last month [January 2023], a European medical journal reported on a bird flu outbreak in October [2022] at a mink farm in Spain with nearly 52 000 animals, where the illness spread like wildfire [ProMED post 20221023.8706335].

The mink were fed poultry, and wild birds in the region had been found to have bird flu. But researchers said that however it started, they believe the virus then spread from mink to mink, a worrisome scenario. No workers were infected, though they wore masks as part of COVID-19 precautions.

Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health, said the outbreak virus is being watched for mutations that could make it more easily transmitted to people, and potentially between people.

""That's the real worry,"" said Nuzzo.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
-------
During the 2020 to 2022 epizootic of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAI), several infections of mammalian species were reported in Europe. In the Netherlands, HPAI H5N1 virus infections were detected in 3 wild red foxes (_Vulpes vulpes_) that were submitted with neurological symptoms between December 2021 and February 2022. A histopathological analysis demonstrated that the virus was mainly present in the brain, with limited or no detection in the respiratory tract or other organs.

Limited or no virus shedding was observed in throat and rectal swabs. A phylogenetic analysis showed that the 3 fox viruses were not closely related, but they were related to HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b viruses that are found in wild birds. This suggests that the virus was not transmitted between the foxes. A genetic analysis demonstrated the presence of the mammalian adaptation E627K in the polymerase basic 2 (PB2) protein of the 2 fox viruses. In both foxes, the avian (PB2-627E) and the mammalian (PB2-627K) variants were present as a mixture in the virus population, which suggests that the mutation emerged in these specific animals. The 2 variant viruses were isolated, and virus replication and passaging experiments were performed. These experiments showed that the mutation PB2-627K increases the replication of the virus in mammalian cell lines, compared to the chicken cell line, and at the lower temperatures of the mammalian upper respiratory tract.

This study showed that the HPAI H5N1 virus is capable of adaptation to mammals; however, more adaptive mutations are required to allow for efficient transmission between mammals. Therefore, surveillance in mammals should be expanded to closely monitor the emergence of zoonotic mutations for pandemic preparedness.

[The following wildlife-oriented comment by Mod.PMB is complementary: ""Infections by HPAI viruses in mammals are typically uncommon, although since April 2022 there have been several events of Eurasian HPAI H5N1 in wild carnivores (Order Carnivora). Most reports have been done in red foxes (_Vulpes vulpes_, Family Canidae), but skunks (Family Mephitidae), raccoons (Family Procyonidae), seals (Suborder Pinnipedia, Family Phocidae), bears (Family Ursidae), and otters (Mustelidae) have been added, found infected. There have also been 3 cases in cetaceans"" (ProMED post 20230123.8707926).

The numbers of human cases and deaths due to avian influenza A(H5N1) virus, accumulated since 2003, as often cited in media reports and scientific publications, are 868 and 457, respectively. For the annual numbers, per country, please refer to table 2 at <https://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/global_statistics_avian_influenza_e.pdf>. The highest numbers were reported from Egypt (359 cases, 120 died), Indonesia (200, 168 died), Cambodia (56, 37), Mainland China (54, 32), Viet Nam (127, 64), and Thailand (25, 17). These data deserve being viewed with caution; for example, India reported one single (and fatal) case throughout the entire period. Most cases, globally, were recorded during the years 2003-2009 (468 cases, of which 282 fatal). In 2015 the numbers peaked due to the Egyptian epidemic. Since 2016 only sporadic cases were reported globally, totalling 22 (11, fatal) as of 20 Feb 2023.

While during the COVID-19 pandemic, the role of animals was mainly viewed in the context of academic, retrospective investigations into the origin of the pathogen while animals, primarily pets (but also minks!), were getting infected from man (reversed zoonosis), avian influenza is another story. The virus causes direct, tremendous losses to farm animals and to wildlife. The increased involvement of mammals is alarming, in view of the potential mutation of the virus. With the history of the 1918 pandemic in mind, and as concluded in all above reports and many others, published recently, a One Health, pro-active approach is, literally, vital. It prescribes coordinated, intensified surveillance in domestic and wild animals, even in remote regions, accompanied by virological investigations, and biosecurity-guided behaviour of those exposed to infected animals as well as the public at large. - Mod.AS]

Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus Infections in Wild Red Foxes (_Vulpes vulpes_) Show Neurotropism and Adaptive Virus Mutations. Microbiol Spectrum. 2023; e0286722; doi: 10.1128/spectrum.02867-22.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Abstract-------During the 2020 to 2022 epizootic of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAI), several infections of mammalian species were reported in Europe. In the Netherlands, HPAI H5N1 virus infections were detected in 3 wild red foxes (_Vulpes vulpes_) that were submitted with neurological symptoms between December 2021 and February 2022. A histopathological analysis demonstrated that the virus was mainly present in the brain, with limited or no detection in the respiratory tract or other organs.Limited or no virus shedding was observed in throat and rectal swabs. A phylogenetic analysis showed that the 3 fox viruses were not closely related, but they were related to HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b viruses that are found in wild birds. This suggests that the virus was not transmitted between the foxes. A genetic analysis demonstrated the presence of the mammalian adaptation E627K in the polymerase basic 2 (PB2) protein of the 2 fox viruses. In both foxes, the avian (PB2-627E) and the mammalian (PB2-627K) variants were present as a mixture in the virus population, which suggests that the mutation emerged in these specific animals. The 2 variant viruses were isolated, and virus replication and passaging experiments were performed. These experiments showed that the mutation PB2-627K increases the replication of the virus in mammalian cell lines, compared to the chicken cell line, and at the lower temperatures of the mammalian upper respiratory tract.This study showed that the HPAI H5N1 virus is capable of adaptation to mammals; however, more adaptive mutations are required to allow for efficient transmission between mammals. Therefore, surveillance in mammals should be expanded to closely monitor the emergence of zoonotic mutations for pandemic preparedness.--Communicated by:ProMED[The following wildlife-oriented comment by Mod.PMB is complementary: ""Infections by HPAI viruses in mammals are typically uncommon, although since April 2022 there have been several events of Eurasian HPAI H5N1 in wild carnivores (Order Carnivora). Most reports have been done in red foxes (_Vulpes vulpes_, Family Canidae), but skunks (Family Mephitidae), raccoons (Family Procyonidae), seals (Suborder Pinnipedia, Family Phocidae), bears (Family Ursidae), and otters (Mustelidae) have been added, found infected. There have also been 3 cases in cetaceans"" (ProMED post 20230123.8707926).The numbers of human cases and deaths due to avian influenza A(H5N1) virus, accumulated since 2003, as often cited in media reports and scientific publications, are 868 and 457, respectively. For the annual numbers, per country, please refer to table 2 at <https://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/global_statistics_avian_influenza_e.pdf>. The highest numbers were reported from Egypt (359 cases, 120 died), Indonesia (200, 168 died), Cambodia (56, 37), Mainland China (54, 32), Viet Nam (127, 64), and Thailand (25, 17). These data deserve being viewed with caution; for example, India reported one single (and fatal) case throughout the entire period. Most cases, globally, were recorded during the years 2003-2009 (468 cases, of which 282 fatal). In 2015 the numbers peaked due to the Egyptian epidemic. Since 2016 only sporadic cases were reported globally, totalling 22 (11, fatal) as of 20 Feb 2023.While during the COVID-19 pandemic, the role of animals was mainly viewed in the context of academic, retrospective investigations into the origin of the pathogen while animals, primarily pets (but also minks!), were getting infected from man (reversed zoonosis), avian influenza is another story. The virus causes direct, tremendous losses to farm animals and to wildlife. The increased involvement of mammals is alarming, in view of the potential mutation of the virus. With the history of the 1918 pandemic in mind, and as concluded in all above reports and many others, published recently, a One Health, pro-active approach is, literally, vital. It prescribes coordinated, intensified surveillance in domestic and wild animals, even in remote regions, accompanied by virological investigations, and biosecurity-guided behaviour of those exposed to infected animals as well as the public at large. - Mod.AS]","KSL Broadcasting via Associated Press, The Veterinary Record, JAMA, Microbiology Spectrum",,

The NPPO [National Plant Protection Organisation] of France recently informed EPPO of the 1st finding of _Geosmithia morbida_ (EPPO A2 List) on its territory. The fungus, which is associated with the thousand cankers disease, was detected in central France in a park on 3 symptomatic walnut (_Juglans regia_) trees. The identity of the fungus was confirmed in November 2022 by morphological and molecular methods.

The detection occurred during surveys following capture of the insect vector _Pityophthorus juglandis_ (EPPO A2 List) in the area in September 2022 (EPPO RS 2022/232). A specific survey for _G. morbida_ and its vector will be carried out, including visual examination of host plants, sampling of symptomatic trees, and inspections of sites at risk. The source of this outbreak is under investigation.

[Thousand cankers disease (TCD) of walnuts (_Juglans_ species) and other species in the family Juglandaceae is considered a disease complex involving the fungus _Geosmithia morbida_ (and possibly also other fungal species). It is spread by the walnut twig beetle (_Pityophthorus juglandis_; family _Curculionidae_, snout and bark beetles). The insect-fungus association, originating in North America, is considered to represent a new and significant threat to walnut species in the Americas and now also in Europe.

The fungus blocks the circulation system of the host. Symptoms may resemble drought stress and include yellowing, wilting, and browning of leaves, with subsequent canker development around beetle galleries. Affected mature trees may die within a year or less. Infectious vector beetles can spread on their own or be transported by human activities (such as wood transports). The fungus has a high mutation rate, and no resistant host cultivars are currently available. Phytosanitary and cultural measures, such as preventing bark damage as well as preventative systemic pesticide applications to avoid beetle infestation have been suggested, but no effective control options are currently known.


In Europe, the disease was reported for the 1st time from Italy in 2014 (ProMED post 20140206.2258062) on black walnut (_J. nigra_), its main host and an important forest tree in the Americas. The source of that incursion is unknown but is thought to have been infected vector insects on wood from the USA. The host of the new outbreak in France above, _J. regia_, is only a minor host in the Americas, but it is the main species grown for culinary walnuts in Europe, which further increases the risk from TCD for the region. Further details for the report above have most recently been published (see link below).

Hepatitis A has broken out at Wathu village in Shopian district; 5 persons have tested positive. Samples of 150 persons have been also taken for the testing. This is not for the 1st time in recent times that hepatitis A has broken out in any South Kashmir village. According to reports, earlier some cases were reported from Ganowpora area in the same district. Few months back, 2 children had died due to hepatitis A at Turka Tachloo village in south Kashmir. The medical experts have been saying that consuming of unsafe water is the main cause for hepatitis A in the villages.

The health department should take more steps so that the further spread of the disease is stopped immediately. Those infected should get immediate treatment. If there is need for hospitalization in some cases, it should be done. The people should co-operate with the medical teams and listen to them and strictly follow their guidelines.

More testing needs to be not only in the affected village but in the other adjoining areas also. The medical teams must visit the affected areas on a regular basis for the time-being so that the affected people continue to get treatment and advice, and the rest of the population is educated about using only safe water for drinking.

Use of unboiled water should be avoided till safe water is made available. Awareness must be created among the people how to remain safe from hepatitis A. While the medical teams will do their job, providing of safe water is the responsibility of Jal Shakti Department.

No compromise should be made on this front. Reports quoting the villagers of Wathu say that there is some problem in the filtration plant. They alleged that nothing was done even as the matter was taken up with the concerned officials several times. They demand supply of safe water through tankers for the time-being. There is nothing wrong in their demand. All necessary steps should be taken to keep the water safe. The filtration of water and other required procedures must be adopted before the drinking water is supplied to people for consumption.

It is not about the affected village only; an exercise should be carried in other areas also to find out whether the water being supplied is safe. There are complaints of unsafe water from some other areas also.

A brand of almond milk behind a case of botulism in Australia was missing storage information, according to investigators. Inside Out Nutritious Goods has expanded a recall because products are not labeled with instructions to keep refrigerated. Authorities said failure to refrigerate the products can lead to microbial growth and biotoxin contamination, which may cause illness if consumed. Botulism is a rare but life-threatening condition caused by toxins produced by the _Clostridium botulinum_ bacterium.

Initially, the company recalled JS Health x Inside Out Unsweetened Almond Milk Collagen + Calcium + Prebiotics sold in Woolworths stores in New South Wales (NSW). Now, 1-liter JS Health x Inside Out Unsweetened Oat Milk Collagen + Calcium + Prebiotics and the Barista version are affected. Drinks were sold at Woolworths outlets nationally and have a use-by date up to and including 18 May 2023. The earlier recall was updated following an NSW Department of Primary Industries inspection of the Inside Out manufacturing facility, which found the plant was in compliance with regulations and relevant standards.

The product is sold chilled and must be kept refrigerated. Consumers should not drink the beverage if it has not been kept refrigerated and stored below 4 degrees C (39.2 degrees F). One person suffered severe symptoms of botulism after drinking the dairy alternative. This person was hospitalized, and they are continuing to receive treatment. Investigations by authorities have confirmed the presence of botulinum toxin in a sample of the product. The NSW Food Authority is investigating the manufacturing process to determine the possible cause of contamination.


Growth of the bacterium and formation of toxins occurs in products with low oxygen content and certain combinations of storage temperature and preservation methods. Refrigeration temperatures combined with salt content or acidic conditions will prevent the growth of the bacteria and the formation of toxins, according to the WHO.

Botulism is extremely rare in Australia with 26 cases recorded since 1992. Only 3 of these have been foodborne.

Inside Out Nutritious Goods said it takes food safety, labeling, storage and handling instructions seriously. ""Our thoughts are with the affected customer and we wish them a speedy recovery. As soon as we were informed of a potential contamination issue, we commenced a voluntary recall and have been providing every assistance to the relevant authorities. We are working with NSW Health and the NSW Food Authority to investigate what has happened. Inside Out is also engaging independent experts to investigate the matter,"" said a company statement.

The symptoms of botulism may include some or all of the following: double vision, blurred vision, drooping eyelids, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, difficulty breathing, a thick-feeling tongue, dry mouth, and muscle weakness. People with botulism poisoning may not show all of these symptoms at once. These symptoms result from muscle paralysis caused by the toxin. If untreated, the disease may progress, and symptoms may worsen to cause paralysis of specific muscles, including those used in breathing and those in the arms, legs, and the body from the neck to the pelvis area.

[It is not specifically stated if the serotype of botulinum toxin found in the almond milk was the same causing the intoxication in the clinical case. The timing and method of contamination of the product are not clear, nor is whether the storage of the product was done appropriately, but it seems a warning to keep refrigerated was lacking. A food recall of spaghetti sauce related to a similar issue occurred in Quebec, Canada in 2020, but no clinical cases occurred (Botulism - Canada (02): (QC) spaghetti sauce, risk, recall, alert 20200929.7820697). Sodium citrate is often added to canned product to acidify the contents and decrease the risk of botulinum spores to germinate. The pH of almond milk is about 6, not low enough to do this.


Foodborne botulism usually occurs when preformed toxin is absorbed through the intestinal tract, and when the botulinum toxin is exposed to the neuromuscular junction, the heavy chain of the botulinum neurotoxin binds to glycoprotein structures specifically found on cholinergic nerve terminals.

.................................................jh/ll/rd/mpp","A brand of almond milk behind a case of botulism in Australia was missing storage information, according to investigators. Inside Out Nutritious Goods has expanded a recall because products are not labeled with instructions to keep refrigerated. Authorities said failure to refrigerate the products can lead to microbial growth and biotoxin contamination, which may cause illness if consumed. Botulism is a rare but life-threatening condition caused by toxins produced by the _Clostridium botulinum_ bacterium.Initially, the company recalled JS Health x Inside Out Unsweetened Almond Milk Collagen + Calcium + Prebiotics sold in Woolworths stores in New South Wales (NSW). Now, 1-liter JS Health x Inside Out Unsweetened Oat Milk Collagen + Calcium + Prebiotics and the Barista version are affected. Drinks were sold at Woolworths outlets nationally and have a use-by date up to and including 18 May 2023. The earlier recall was updated following an NSW Department of Primary Industries inspection of the Inside Out manufacturing facility, which found the plant was in compliance with regulations and relevant standards.The product is sold chilled and must be kept refrigerated. Consumers should not drink the beverage if it has not been kept refrigerated and stored below 4 degrees C (39.2 degrees F). One person suffered severe symptoms of botulism after drinking the dairy alternative. This person was hospitalized, and they are continuing to receive treatment. Investigations by authorities have confirmed the presence of botulinum toxin in a sample of the product. The NSW Food Authority is investigating the manufacturing process to determine the possible cause of contamination.Growth of the bacterium and formation of toxins occurs in products with low oxygen content and certain combinations of storage temperature and preservation methods. Refrigeration temperatures combined with salt content or acidic conditions will prevent the growth of the bacteria and the formation of toxins, according to the WHO.Botulism is extremely rare in Australia with 26 cases recorded since 1992. Only 3 of these have been foodborne.Inside Out Nutritious Goods said it takes food safety, labeling, storage and handling instructions seriously. ""Our thoughts are with the affected customer and we wish them a speedy recovery. As soon as we were informed of a potential contamination issue, we commenced a voluntary recall and have been providing every assistance to the relevant authorities. We are working with NSW Health and the NSW Food Authority to investigate what has happened. Inside Out is also engaging independent experts to investigate the matter,"" said a company statement.The symptoms of botulism may include some or all of the following: double vision, blurred vision, drooping eyelids, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, difficulty breathing, a thick-feeling tongue, dry mouth, and muscle weakness. People with botulism poisoning may not show all of these symptoms at once. These symptoms result from muscle paralysis caused by the toxin. If untreated, the disease may progress, and symptoms may worsen to cause paralysis of specific muscles, including those used in breathing and those in the arms, legs, and the body from the neck to the pelvis area.--Communicated by:ProMED[It is not specifically stated if the serotype of botulinum toxin found in the almond milk was the same causing the intoxication in the clinical case. The timing and method of contamination of the product are not clear, nor is whether the storage of the product was done appropriately, but it seems a warning to keep refrigerated was lacking. A food recall of spaghetti sauce related to a similar issue occurred in Quebec, Canada in 2020, but no clinical cases occurred (Botulism - Canada (02): (QC) spaghetti sauce, risk, recall, alert 20200929.7820697). Sodium citrate is often added to canned product to acidify the contents and decrease the risk of botulinum spores to germinate. The pH of almond milk is about 6, not low enough to do this.Foodborne botulism usually occurs when preformed toxin is absorbed through the intestinal tract, and when the botulinum toxin is exposed to the neuromuscular junction, the heavy chain of the botulinum neurotoxin binds to glycoprotein structures specifically found on cholinergic nerve terminals. This specific docking is the reason for botulinum toxin's (BT's) high selectivity for cholinergic synapses. After internalization, the light chain of the botulinum neurotoxin binds with high specificity to the SNARE protein complex. The target proteins vary among the BT serotypes.

Bird flu has killed tens of thousands of birds, mostly pelicans, and at least 716 sea lions in protected areas across Peru, the authorities said, as the H5N1 strain spreads throughout the region.

Peru recorded its 1st case of the virus in November [2022] in birds in the north of the country. Since then it has killed 63 000 birds, according to government data.

""We have also recorded since mid-January [2023] the unusual death of many sea lions, so far we have about 716 dead sea lions in 7 protected natural areas of the coast,"" said Roberto Gutierrez, head of surveillance of the National Service of Natural Protected Areas.

Since the beginning of 2021, bird flu has ravaged the world, killing more than 200 million birds due to disease or mass culling, the World Organization for Animal Health has said.

In South America, bird flu cases have been detected in Ecuador, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay, and recently in Argentina and Uruguay. In Brazil, the world's largest poultry exporter, there are still no confirmed cases.

In Chile, health authorities last week [week of 13 Feb 2023] detected the 1st positive case in a marine mammal, a sea lion on a beach in the north of the country.

The population of sea lions numbered about 110 000 in Peru in 2020, mainly in the coastal region of Ica and the Paracas nature reserve, according to Oceana, an international organization dedicated to protecting oceans.

In recent weeks [February 2023], crews from Peru's National Forestry and Wildlife Service, in protective plastic suits, gloves, and masks, have collected and buried hundreds of sea lions from several beaches along Peru's central coast.

""What we remember initially started with pelicans last year [2022] is now affecting these marine mammals,"" Javier Jara, a veterinarian with the service, said.

[The Eurasian HPAI H5N1 virus was first detected in January 2022 on the Atlantic coast of North America, and rapidly spread to many States of the USA, Canada, and Mexico, probably introduced to the Americas by one of the numerous species of birds that migrate along Nearctic and Palearctic flyways and breed in Arctic tundra regions. In November 2022, H5N1 was first detected in South America in pelicans from Peru, probably brought by infected migrants such as the blue-winged teal (_Anas discors_), which breed in North America and many winter in northern South America, including Peru. The report mentions Uruguay because a black-necked swan was recently detected infected in Rocha.

The list of countries where HPAI H5N1 has been detected south of Mexico includes Colombia, Peru, Venezuela, Chile, Bolivia, Uruguay, and Argentina. Passive and active surveillance should be enhanced in poultry and wild birds of the Neotropical region. 

Infections by HPAI viruses in mammals are typically not common, but since April 2022 there have been several events of Eurasian HPAI H5N1 in a wide spectrum of wild carnivores (order Carnivora). There have been reports have been in red foxes (_Vulpes vulpes_, family Canidae), bobcats (family Felidae), skunks (family Mephitidae), raccoons (family Procyonidae), bears (family Ursidae), otters (family Mustelidae), and seals and sea lions (suborder Pinnipedia, family Phocidae and family Otariidae, respectively). There have also been cases in cetaceans.

The numbers reported here suggest a considerable impact on the sea lion population of Peru. - Mod.PMB

As many as 7 residents of Sukahurip Village, Pangatikan District, Garut Regency, died of suspected exposure to diphtheria [bacterium]. This was confirmed by the Head of the Surveillance Team, Dewi Ambarwati, when contacted by cell phone, Tuesday [21 Feb 2023]. Dewi said the number occurred in the period of 6-19 February 2023. In early February there were 6 (dead), then added one more on [19 Feb 2023].

Dewi said that she did not yet know the exact cause of the death of the 7 people. However, based on preliminary analysis, they had close contact with residents affected by diphtheria.

These 7 people were not checked to determine whether they had diphtheria or not. However, because we suspected that the time of death was very close and we finally looked for those who had contact with those who had died and found 2 people who were positive (diphtheria),"" she said.

In response to this, the West Java Health Office dispatched a team to the field to examine the condition of people who had close contact with people exposed to diphtheria, especially in the Sukahurip Village area.

""So children aged 15 and under in the village are subjected to an outbreak response. So we will inject all of them with diphtheria immunization,"" she said.

The West Java Health Office has also declared the status of an Extraordinary Event (KLB) of diphtheria in Garut Regency. ""We say KLB. Meaning, we can say just one case (diphtheria) is KLB. So after that, we are looking for it in other cities to be examined,"" said Dewi.

According to Dewi, exposure to [_Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, the cause of diphtheria is a bacterium] can be prevented by injecting immunization. Therefore, the government will continue to carry out immunization efforts in the area with a joint approach from local community leaders.

""This village (Sukahurip) has a very high penalty, in the last 3 years the immunization coverage has been very low due to religious reasons,"" he said.

""Because this disease can be prevented by administering immunization according to a schedule -- for children under 11 months, later at the age of 2 years, and later at elementary school age -- the child's immunization must be repeated,"" she explained.

The Garut Regency Government has declared an Extraordinary Event Status (KLB) related to diphtheria cases in Sukahurip Village, Pangatikan District, Garut Regency. The status of the KLB has been determined since [Sun 19 Feb 2023).

RSUD Dr Slamet [Regional General Hospital] Garut Regency, Deputy Director of Services, Willy Indrawilis, said his party had prepared a special room to anticipate a spike in diphtheria cases. Indeed, the management of diphtheria cases must be carried out in an isolation room.

""There were 3 people (diphtheria cases) being treated at RSUD. They have been admitted since Saturday [18 Feb 2023],"" he said when confirmed by the Republika on Tuesday [21 Feb 2023].

According to him, the 3 people who are all children were placed in the isolation room of Dr Slamet Hospital. The reason is that the spread of diphtheria is considered easy.

According to him, so far, there have been no other referrals concerning cases of diphtheria. However, a team from the Garut district health office is still carrying out investigations on the ground.

""We have also prepared a place for the isolation of patients. We have prepared 7 rooms with 14 beds, but only 3 (beds) are used,"" Willy said.

Regarding the condition of the diphtheria patient being treated at Dr Slamet Hospital, Willy explained, all 3 children had symptoms of swollen necks and white membranes in their throats. However, currently, their condition is considered to be improving. ""They were given diphtheria medication, and the swelling in the neck has gone down,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Garut district health office secretary Leli Yuliani said that so far there have been no additional diphtheria cases in Sukahurip village. However, he still continues to conduct field research.

""No (no additions),"" he said when confirmed by the Republika on Tuesday [21 Feb 2023].

Based on the latest data as of Sunday [19 Feb 2023], there were 72 diphtheria cases in Sukahurip village, the majority of which were in children. Of the total cases, 4 people were included in the category of cases of observation of diphtheria, 4 suspected diphtheria, 2 cases of positive confirmation of diphtheria, 55 close contacts, and 7 people died without complete medical records (epidemiological link).

Also referring to the data, up to 3 people are currently undergoing treatment at Dr Slamet Hospital, Garut Regency. In addition, 8 other people are in independent isolation.

Leli said the Garut Regency government has also established an epidemic status regarding the diphtheria case in Sukahurip village. According to him, the KLB status will be valid until October 2023.

""Later, ORI (outbreak response immunization) will be done 3 times, at 0 months, 1 month, and 6 months,"" he said.

Earlier, Deputy Regent of Garut Helmi Budiman called on the community in Sukahurip village to immediately report to officers if they have symptoms of diphtheria. Health centers in the region are said to have opened special service posts for diphtheria.

""Officers will regularly perform swab checks on people in Sukahurip village who show symptoms,"" he said Monday [20 Feb 2023].

Helmi added that patients who have been diagnosed with diphtheria will be isolated in hospital if they need medical treatment. While close contacts will receive prophylactic treatment so that they do not contract diphtheria.

""I also recommend minimizing mobility. Then in this village we recommend wearing a mask,"" he said.

In addition, Helmi said, the Garut district health office will carry out mass vaccination in Sukahurip village. This effort should prevent diphtheria from spreading.

The number of newborns treated for congenital syphilis, an infection passed from their mothers, has dramatically increased in Mississippi [USA] over the past 5 years. Experts say this may be due to limited access to prenatal care and a lack of insurance.

An analysis of hospital bill data shared with NBC News and collected by Thomas Dobbs, MD, the medical director for the Mississippi State Department of Health's Crossroads Clinic in Jackson, reveals that cases of congenital syphilis rose by more than 900% in Mississippi [<https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/congenital-syphilis-treatment-mississippi-increase-rcna69381>]. In 2021, some 102 newborns in the state were treated for the condition, compared to only 10 babies in 2016.

Dobbs said that healthcare providers ""are absolutely horrified.""

""Mississippi is experiencing a frightening increase in pregnant women with syphilis and in turn, babies born with syphilis,"" said Dobbs, who is also a dean of the John D Bower School of Population Health at the University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC).

Congenital syphilis may have profound implications on a newborn's health, such as deformed bones, anemia, damaged organs, and brain and nerve problems. In most severe cases, the infection may lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, and premature birth, according to the CDC.

""Several newborns have died recently due to this entirely preventable problem. Other children have been diagnosed with severe neurological development disorders because of untreated syphilis,"" Dobbs said in a UMMC statement.

All pregnant women should be tested for syphilis at the 1st prenatal visit and treated with penicillin right away if they test positive, the CDC said. Mississippi, however, is one of the 6 states where syphilis screenings in pregnancy are not required by law.

Overall, STDs in the United States are skyrocketing [<https://healthnews.com/news/new-us-health-statistics-reveal-cancer-mortality-decreased-while-new-std-cases-skyrocketed/>]. The preliminary CDC data show that syphilis cases rose from 101 590 in 2017 to 171 074 in 2021. The same trend is observed in Mississippi, where new syphilis cases nearly tripled from 2013 to 2016.

Charlotte Hobbs, MD, professor of pediatric infectious diseases at UMMC, said that delayed prenatal care and testing are the main reasons women with syphilis are not getting treatment, followed by delays in accessing antibiotics. ""To combat this public health crisis, our priority must be to engage moms early in pregnancy and ensure testing and treatment. This will require a committed partnership between physicians and clinics, public health, and insurers, primarily Medicaid,"" she added.

According to the doctors, the key to addressing this crisis is early prenatal care, access to which is limited by the lack of insurance and maternal care deserts.

Dobbs said, ""From my discussions with physicians across the state, uninsured pregnant women must pay for care out-of-pocket prior to Medicaid approval. Although Medicaid will reimburse retroactively, most clinics require either payment or proof of insurance. This costly delay often puts women well beyond the 1st trimester before receiving care.""

Children and women in Mississippi aren't the [only] ones impacted. California, Minnesota, and New Mexico have reported increases as well.

[Trends in the number of congenital syphilis cases reflect rates of P&S syphilis among reproductive aged women. Since 2013, the rate of congenital syphilis has increased each year. In 2014, the incidence rate of reported congenital syphilis cases in the US was 11.6 cases per 100 000 live births (<https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6444a3.htm>). By 2020, the national congenital syphilis rate of 57.3 cases per 100 000 live births represents a 394% increase relative to 2014 (<https://www.cdc.gov/std/statistics/2020/overview.htm>).

In a CDC study of about 1300 cases of congenital syphilis reported nationwide in 2018, ""missed opportunities"" for prevention of congenital syphilis occurred, which varied by region (<https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6922a1.htm>). Racial/ethnic disparities existed within the highest morbidity regions: in the South, the most commonly missed prevention opportunity among white mothers of infants with congenital syphilis was no timely prenatal care and no timely syphilis testing (31.6%), whereas, among black and Hispanic mothers, no adequate maternal treatment despite a timely syphilis diagnosis (37%) was the commonest. These differences in missed prevention opportunities require strategies that are tailored to local situations.

The US states with rates of congenital syphilis above the national average in 2019 (48.5 cases per 100 000 live births) were in the South and Southwest, including Texas (138.2), Arizona (133.1), New Mexico (117.8), Nevada (114.7), Louisiana (111.4), California (94.3), Oklahoma (85.6), Florida (64.8), and Arkansas (56.0); however, in 2019, Mississippi ranked 40th, with 3 cases and a rate per 100 000 live births of 8.0 (<https://www.cdc.gov/std/statistics/2019/std-surveillance-2019.pdf>, Table 40). In 2021, there were 102 cases of congenital syphilis in newborns in the state.

Poverty and other social determinants have a big impact on rates of syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases among women. More information on factors driving this increase in syphilis in Mississippi would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML

At least 5 girl students of Purubai Kanyashram hostel in the coastal Balasore district have tested positive for Japanese encephalitis 2 days after they were admitted to a government hospital complaining of fever, headache, and vomiting, district officials said.

On Saturday evening [18 Feb 2023], a class 10 student of the hostel, who complained of nausea and headache, passed away at Balasore district headquarters hospital a day after she was admitted.

Though her samples did not indicate the cause of her death, 5 others who were admitted along with her to the district headquarter hospital were found positive for the virus.

""We don't know how they got infected with Japanese encephalitis. But we got the students tested after they showed all signs of encephalitis. A detailed investigation would reveal how they were infected. As pigs are the carrier it's possible that the students had come in contact with pigs,"" said Dr Mrutyunjay Mishra, additional district medical officer, Balasore district. [This is incorrect. Pigs are amplifying hosts and do not transmit the virus directly to people. _Culex_ mosquitoes are the vectors and undoubtedly transmitted the virus to the girls. These mosquitoes may acquire the virus from pigs or from aquatic birds. - Mod.TY]

Meanwhile, 25 other girl students of the hostel who had similar symptoms as those with encephalitis tested negative for the virus. However, they are being kept under close observation, according to the officials.

Japanese encephalitis is a viral brain infection that's spread through mosquito bites. It is vector-borne in which the infected patients suffer from fever and abdominal pain and experience recurrent vomiting. Many of the affected patients have hypoglycaemia.

In Malkangiri district of Odisha, a severe outbreak of Japanese encephalitis and acute encephalitis syndrome was reported from September to November 2016, in which 336 children were affected, and 103 deaths were reported in the age group of 4 months to 13 years.

Current weather conditions are not optimal for wheat crops and farmers are advised to be vigilant to avoid yield loss. The department of Agriculture in Ambala district said that grain weight is likely to decrease with higher temperature. Current conditions are also conducive for fungal development. Field staff have been directed to be watchful. Farmers have been advised to report to the department if they find yellow rust in their fields so that the disease can be contained.

The disease spreads very quickly, so regular monitoring and timely prevention is needed to control it. Farmers were advised to consult experts for confirmation of yellow rust and spray fungicides. Camps are being organised to educate farmers. Over 87 000 hectares [214 982 acres] are under wheat crops in the district in 2023.

[Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the fungus _Puccinia striiformis_. The disease affects wheat (_Triticum aestivum_), durum wheat (_T. turgidum_), some barley varieties, triticale (wheat/rye hybrids), and a number of wild grasses. It causes yellow stripes on leaves leading to loss of photosynthetic ability and plant vigour, as well as stunting of plants. Yield losses of 40-100% have been reported in wheat.

Spores are wind dispersed in several cycles during the cropping season. Grasses and volunteer crop plants may generate a ""green bridge"" providing inoculum for the next crop cycle. Disease monitoring is important so that timely action can be taken to limit the spread of the pathogen as well as build-up of inoculum. Disease management may include the use of resistant crop varieties, fungicide applications and control of pathogen reservoirs. Monitoring and resistance breeding programmes have been established in different regions for early detection of new rust strains and to attempt to stay ahead of pathogen evolution.

While stem rust (_P. graminis_) poses a huge potential threat to world wheat production, stripe rust is currently causing the most damage to wheat crops on a global scale. New strains of both rusts with increased virulence and additional fungicide resistances have been reported in recent years from wheat-growing areas worldwide. Climate warming allowing survival of wheat rusts on green bridges into higher latitudes is another example of pathogens extending their range due to climate change (e.g. ProMED posts 20141024.2895414, 20120809.1235745, 20090914.3230, and 20110718.2172). Projects for double-resistance breeding to manage both stripe and stem rusts simultaneously are in progress (see ProMED post 20120831.1274190).

The Himalayan region, including parts of India and Pakistan, has been identified as a source of most of the aggressive stripe rust races that have arrived in Europe over recent years (ProMED post 20150717.3517395). In India, of the cereal rusts, stripe rust is the most serious constraint to wheat production. A general alert for all wheat rusts has recently also been issued in Pakistan (see link below).

.................................................dha/sb/dha/may/mppx","Current weather conditions are not optimal for wheat crops and farmers are advised to be vigilant to avoid yield loss. The department of Agriculture in Ambala district said that grain weight is likely to decrease with higher temperature. Current conditions are also conducive for fungal development. Field staff have been directed to be watchful. Farmers have been advised to report to the department if they find yellow rust in their fields so that the disease can be contained.The disease spreads very quickly, so regular monitoring and timely prevention is needed to control it. Farmers were advised to consult experts for confirmation of yellow rust and spray fungicides. Camps are being organised to educate farmers. Over 87 000 hectares [214 982 acres] are under wheat crops in the district in 2023.[Byline: Nitish Sharma]--Communicated by:ProMED[Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the fungus _Puccinia striiformis_. The disease affects wheat (_Triticum aestivum_), durum wheat (_T. turgidum_), some barley varieties, triticale (wheat/rye hybrids), and a number of wild grasses. It causes yellow stripes on leaves leading to loss of photosynthetic ability and plant vigour, as well as stunting of plants. Yield losses of 40-100% have been reported in wheat.Spores are wind dispersed in several cycles during the cropping season. Grasses and volunteer crop plants may generate a ""green bridge"" providing inoculum for the next crop cycle. Disease monitoring is important so that timely action can be taken to limit the spread of the pathogen as well as build-up of inoculum. Disease management may include the use of resistant crop varieties, fungicide applications and control of pathogen reservoirs.

Health Alert: U. S. Embassy Malabo, Equatorial Guinea
-----------------------------------------------------
Event: As of the morning of 17 Feb 2023, there have been no new confirmed cases of Marburg Virus Disease (MVD) in Equatorial Guinea (EG) or the surrounding countries. There were 2 suspected cases detected across the border in Cameroon, but blood samples of both individuals tested negative for both MVD and Ebola. Authorities in EG, Cameroon, and Gabon are increasing health surveillance and testing for any individuals displaying possible MVD symptoms, and so reports of suspected cases will likely increase in the days and weeks ahead.

The World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continue to support EG's Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MINSABS) to assist those impacted by the outbreak and to prevent the virus from spreading further. The Kie-Ntem province in the mainland region of EG remains under a general quarantine, and travel out of the province is not allowed, except by medical workers.

The U.S. Embassy will continue to send out regular updates to U.S. citizens living in or traveling to EG until health officials declare an end to the crisis. These alerts will also be posted to the Embassy's website here. More information on MVD can be found on the CDC's website.

Actions to take:
- Immediately report to a qualified medical professional if you experience fever, muscle soreness, weakness, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, or hemorrhaging.
- Avoid contact with any individuals experiencing these symptoms and any people who have had contact with individuals displaying those symptoms.
- Do not eat or handle bushmeat, especially monkeys and other primates. Avoid contact with animal cadavers for any reason.
- Avoid caves or other areas where fruit bat populations are found.
- Practice good hygiene, including regular hand washing.
- Avoid large gatherings and wear a mask when in enclosed spaces.
- Do not attend wakes or funerals.
- Do not attempt to travel to the Kie-Ntem province or surrounding areas until health authorities advise it is safe to do so.
- If you reside in the Kie-Ntem province and/or are subject to the quarantine, alert the U.S. Embassy and follow instructions given by WHO and MINSABS officials.
- Do not attempt to cross the land border between Equatorial Guinea and Cameroon.
- Monitor news programs and websites to stay abreast of new health announcements from the government.
- Check your email regularly for additional updates from U.S. Embassy, Malabo.

The Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) Entomology Research team has announced the discovery of a new malaria vector which poses a serious threat to Kenyans.

In a statement from acting Director General Samuel Kariuki on Sunday, KEMRI said the vector known as _Anopheles stephensi_ was first detected in Laisamis and Saku sub-counties of Marsabit County, where the research was being conducted.

The discovery, made alongside the Ministry of Health's Division of National Malaria Programme (DNMP), shows that the vector thrives in both urban and rural settings which may translate to a high transmission rate.

""Our surveillance studies indicate that the new vector, unlike the traditional malaria-causing mosquitoes namely _A. gambiae_ and _A. [funestus]_, is not only invasive and can spread very fast to new areas, but also adaptive to different climatic and environmental conditions,"" a part of the statement reads.

KEMRI says that further surveillance and studies are ongoing to establish the extent of the strain's distribution and mosquito infectivity rates.

Meanwhile, members of the public have been urged to continue utilizing the available malaria control tools such as using mosquito nets, repellents, and wearing long-sleeved clothing to prevent mosquito bites.

_A. stephensi_ is unique as it thrives in man-made containers such as [jerry] cans, tires, open tanks, sewers, cisterns, overhead tanks and underground tanks, and in polluted environments.

_A. stephensi_ was known to occur and spread malaria in South-East Asia, the Middle East, and Arabian Peninsula. The mosquito species has been expanding its geographic range over the last decade, with detections reported in Djibouti (2012), Ethiopia and Sudan (2016), Somalia (2019), and Nigeria (2020), according to KEMRI.

Kenyan researchers have detected a mosquito native to South Asia that is resistant to insecticides used in Africa.

Experts from the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) identified the mosquito, _Anopheles stephensi_, during routine surveillance in northern Marsabit county.

Data from hospitals there also showed an increase in malaria cases -- even though it was not the normal season for the disease as local mosquitoes don't do well in dry areas.

This invasive mosquito can thrive in both dry and rainy seasons and can breed anywhere. In other countries, its larvae have been found in water containers in urban centres.

Experts are concerned that malaria transmission will now continue all year round instead of being seasonal.

""Unfortunately, this detection in Kenya may translate to higher malaria transmission in urban and peri-urban settings in the country and could reverse gains made in the fight against malaria,"" said KEMRI's director-general, Samuel Kariuki.

It will also make it difficult to eradicate malaria, which is one of the top killers of children below 5 years.

The researchers are urging Kenyans to use available malaria control tools such as sleeping under treated mosquito bed nets, use of repellents, and wearing long-sleeved clothing to prevent mosquito bites.

In Africa, the mosquito was first detected in Djibouti 10 years ago and has now been spotted in Ethiopia, Sudan, Somalia, and Nigeria.

[The original scientific report on which the articles above are based is available as a downloadable preprint [ref.1].

As discussed in ProMED's most recent post on malaria in Africa, _A. stephensi_ is already the major vector of _P. falciparum_ and _P. vivax_ in urban Ethiopia (see 1st item under See Also below). Given the certainty that this mosquito species will continue to spread through the Horn of Africa, it is not surprising that this 1st detection of _A. stephensi_ in Kenya occurred in Marsabit county, which forms much of Kenya's northern border with Ethiopia.

Because _A. stephensi_ is an urban mosquito and well adapted to dry weather, in contrast to _A. gambiae_, it is likely that malaria transmission and cases will rise in Africa, particularly if and when it reaches large cities [ref.2]. If controlling this urban mosquito proves to be as difficult as controlling the urban _Aedes aegypti_, eradication will not be possible with current approaches and will require a concerted integrated approach. As stated in the Conclusions of a recent perspective on this issue [ref.3]:

""While the presence of _A. stephensi_ in Africa is a concern, it should be viewed as a symptom of a broader and more important problem -- weakened vector surveillance and control programs. The invasion and spread of this vector species is one of multiple biological threats with potential to reverse malaria control and elimination efforts. Research efforts should establish relative contributions of _A. stephensi_ in different malaria transmission settings and identify important ecological and anthropogenic determinants of the species' spread to inform control. Countries and partners should enhance their surveillance systems to map the geographical extents and trajectories of the vectors in and beyond urban areas; and create integrated control programs operating across key sectors and on multiple vector species. The programs should resist any temptation to focus on _A. stephensi_ as a stand-alone threat, but instead adopt more holistic and integrated approaches. Lastly, it is important to involve local stakeholders in affected communities, and to tailor programs to the local context.""

Sweden's largest egg producer, CA Cedergren in Fliseryd, Mönsterås municipality, has had a new confirmed case of salmonella. Several food suppliers are now recalling eggs after the discovery.

In January [2023], CA Cedergren had to kill roughly 164 000 chickens after salmonella bacteria were discovered in one of the coops. Now it has happened again, which the Barometer was the first to report.

""It is a different coop this time, the other one we are still cleaning up"", says Maud Cedergren, operations manager at the company.

On Monday evening [20 Feb 2023], Ica, Coop and Axfood announced that they are recalling several egg packages, after salmonella was discovered during a routine check. CA Cedergren does not want to comment on what caused the outbreak yet.

""It's too early to tell, that's the way it is. We must be allowed to work on this in peace now, and refer to the Swedish Agency for Agriculture"", says Maud Cedergren.

Cleanup is now underway and approximately the same number of chickens as in January [2023] will be euthanized this time.

""In this new coop, there are about 160 000 hens. They must be euthanized because they moved in the infected environment. That's the way we can handle the infection"", says Maria Lundh, veterinarian and infection control officer at the Swedish Agency for Agriculture.
 
Additional eggs from the egg producer outside Mönsterås are now being recalled.

[The continuous or renewed infection of poultry in the same large laying plant, with _S. enteritidis_, an infamous zoonotic pathogen, is concerning, warranting a thorough epidemiological investigation. 

Sweden's policy addressing salmonellosis in animals and humans has been long considered as one of the most effective, globally. A severe domestic outbreak of _Salmonella_ Typhimurium in 1953 that involved more than 9000 people prompted the need for a control programme for _Salmonella_. Since then, the strategy for control has been to prevent _Salmonella_ in all parts of the production chain, from feed to food of animal origin.

When Sweden joined the European Union in 1995, the Swedish _Salmonella_ control programme was accepted. Sweden obtained additional guarantees that food products of animal origin from countries with a non-equivalent _Salmonella_ status should be tested for the presence of _Salmonella_ before being placed on the Swedish market. Specific salmonella-targetting programmes were developed and applied by Sweden's veterinary authorities. Monitoring is structured differently for different animal species. For example, there is mandatory monitoring of all commercial poultry flocks, where regular sampling takes place on the farm. Manufacturers of feed for food-producing animals are obliged to collect environmental samples in the facility every week to check form  salmonella. The feed manufacturer must also have a risk-based self-check to be able to guarantee that the feed does not contain salmonella. For cattle and pigs, among other things, random sample checks are carried out in connection with slaughter and sampling of young animals in connection with necropsy.

The number of newly infected herds is usually between 0 and 10 per animal species. During 2020, some pig herds were infected with a salmonella type that had not been found in Sweden since the 1970s, _Salmonella Choleraesuis_. This salmonella type was also detected among wild boar in some places in the country.

Brucellosis remains one of the urgent problems of the southern region of Kazakhstan, including the Zhambyl region, where in recent years the incidence rate has exceeded the national average by 2-3 times, a Kazinform correspondent reports. The press service of the health department of the Zhambyl region spoke about the state of the incidence of brucellosis and preventive measures.

""In the region, on average, about 150 patients are registered annually. One in 3 comes with a severe form, and one in 5 are children and adolescents; more than 15% of cases become chronic and drag on for decades. Brucellosis is a particularly dangerous infectious disease that affects all human organs and systems. You can get infected with this dangerous infectious disease only from animals with brucellosis and from environmental objects contaminated with the secretions of sick animals,"" the administration explained.

Brucellosis is not transmitted from person to person, the department noted. The disease begins with an increase in body temperature to 39-40 deg C [102-104 deg F], headache, chills, and weakness. Then there are pains and swelling in the joints and damage to the cardiovascular, nervous, and urogenital systems. These phenomena can sometimes pass but then become aggravated again; they can proceed for a long time, leading to disability and incapacity for work.

Every year in the Zhambyl region, before the start of the lambing campaign, letters are sent to akims [governors] of 11 regions of the region, interested departments and services, and territorial departments of the sanitary and epidemiological service for carrying out a set of preventive measures.

""At this time, the health organization of the region, together with the veterinary service, has announced a 3-month period to intensify organizational and methodological work in teams, as well as educate the population on observing the rules of personal hygiene when caring for farm animals. It is necessary to require a veterinary certificate when buying livestock, not to allow sick or unexamined animals into a healthy herd in a private household, to buy livestock products only in designated places, and to require documents certifying the quality and safety of products,"" the press service of the Zhambyl Region Health Department said.

A dozen countries, including the USA, have reported more than 250 _Shigella_ infections in people who went to Cape Verde. An increase in shigellosis cases, mainly caused by _Shigella sonnei_, among travelers returning from Cape Verde, also known as Cabo Verde, has been reported in Europe, the UK, and the USA since September 2022.

Twelve countries have recorded 221 confirmed _Shigella sonnei_ infections and 37 possible cases, all with a link to Cape Verde, which is in West Africa. The UK has the most cases with 95, followed by the Netherlands with 47, Sweden with 42, and France with 31. The USA has 4 patients. Sequencing analysis of 106 human isolates from the Czech Republic, Netherlands, Sweden, UK, and the USA shows a genetically compact cluster suggesting a common source, said health officials.

Of the USA cases, one person reported going to Cape Verde, and the travel history for the other patients is unknown. Sick people include 3 females and one male aged from 3 to 88 years old. Collection dates ranged from 2 Nov 2021 to 2 Oct 2022.

Many ill people stayed in 5-star, all-inclusive hotels in the region of Santa Maria on the island of Sal. The most recent cases were in Sweden in mid-January 2023. Almost 3 times more women than men are affected. Two cases in Portugal were hospitalized.

Multiple modes of transmission are plausible, and the most likely way is through food, including via infected food handlers. However, person-to-person transmission is also possible, said the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC).

_Shigella_ co-infections with other bacterial and parasitic pathogens such as _Salmonella_ Mbandaka, _Campylobacter_, _Cryptosporidium_, and strains of _E. coli_ have been reported among patients. The _Shigella sonnei_ strain in the outbreak shows resistance to trimethoprim and streptomycin, but in some cases multidrug resistance has been found. Detection of a resistance gene against hydrogen peroxide indicates _Shigella sonnei_ isolates' regular exposure to this disinfectant, said ECDC.

ECDC and the European office of the WHO have been in contact with authorities in Cape Verde to support investigations on the sources of infection and to increase awareness among healthcare professionals in the country. Two meetings were held in January [2023] with officials from Cape Verde and the International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN) to discuss the epidemiological situation, based on cases notified in 2022.

[This posting adds the USA as another nation with traveler cases of shigellosis related to Cape Verde. It seems clear that the outbreak is related to unsafe food and water from multiple places and illnesses caused by multiple pathogens. Certainly, the genetic analysis suggests a commonality of the source of the _S. sonnei_ isolates. - Mod.LL

.................................................sb/ll/tw/mpp","A dozen countries, including the USA, have reported more than 250 _Shigella_ infections in people who went to Cape Verde. An increase in shigellosis cases, mainly caused by _Shigella sonnei_, among travelers returning from Cape Verde, also known as Cabo Verde, has been reported in Europe, the UK, and the USA since September 2022.Twelve countries have recorded 221 confirmed _Shigella sonnei_ infections and 37 possible cases, all with a link to Cape Verde, which is in West Africa. The UK has the most cases with 95, followed by the Netherlands with 47, Sweden with 42, and France with 31. The USA has 4 patients. Sequencing analysis of 106 human isolates from the Czech Republic, Netherlands, Sweden, UK, and the USA shows a genetically compact cluster suggesting a common source, said health officials.Of the USA cases, one person reported going to Cape Verde, and the travel history for the other patients is unknown. Sick people include 3 females and one male aged from 3 to 88 years old. Collection dates ranged from 2 Nov 2021 to 2 Oct 2022.Many ill people stayed in 5-star, all-inclusive hotels in the region of Santa Maria on the island of Sal. The most recent cases were in Sweden in mid-January 2023. Almost 3 times more women than men are affected. Two cases in Portugal were hospitalized.Multiple modes of transmission are plausible, and the most likely way is through food, including via infected food handlers. However, person-to-person transmission is also possible, said the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC)._Shigella_ co-infections with other bacterial and parasitic pathogens such as _Salmonella_ Mbandaka, _Campylobacter_, _Cryptosporidium_, and strains of _E. coli_ have been reported among patients. The _Shigella sonnei_ strain in the outbreak shows resistance to trimethoprim and streptomycin, but in some cases multidrug resistance has been found. Detection of a resistance gene against hydrogen peroxide indicates _Shigella sonnei_ isolates' regular exposure to this disinfectant, said ECDC.ECDC and the European office of the WHO have been in contact with authorities in Cape Verde to support investigations on the sources of infection and to increase awareness among healthcare professionals in the country. Two meetings were held in January [2023] with officials from Cape Verde and the International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN) to discuss the epidemiological situation, based on cases notified in 2022.[Byline: Joe Whitworth]--Communicated by:ProMED from HealthMap Alerts[This posting adds the USA as another nation with traveler cases of shigellosis related to Cape Verde. It seems clear that the outbreak is related to unsafe food and water from multiple places and illnesses caused by multiple pathogens. Certainly, the genetic analysis suggests a commonality of the source of the _S. sonnei_ isolates. - Mod.LLProMED map:Cape Verde: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8708521,15>]",Food Safety News,,

The Schuyler County Health Department (MO) reported on Friday, 17 Feb 2023, they were notified of multiple cases of pertussis, also known as whooping cough, in the county. On Sunday, 19 Feb 2023, however, they reported those cases were confirmed as parapertussis, which is a respiratory illness that presents similar symptoms as pertussis but is less severe and less infectious.

Parapertussis does not require mandated reporting or management by communicable disease programs. People exposed to the illness should watch for symptoms 7-10 days after suspected exposure.

CHP investigates case of human infection of rat hepatitis E virus
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today [16 Feb 2023] said that it is investigating a case of human infection of rat hepatitis E virus (HEV) and urged members of the public to be vigilant against hepatitis E infection and to strictly observe good personal, food, and environmental hygiene. The case involves a 28-year-old man with underlying illnesses. He was found to have a deranged liver function during his follow-up at Queen Elizabeth Hospital. The patient is now in stable condition. His blood sample tested positive for rat HEV upon laboratory testing.

The CHP's epidemiological investigations revealed that the patient resides in Ho Man Tin. He did not have contact with rodents or rats and had no travel history during the incubation period. ""Based on the available epidemiological information, the source and the route of infection could not be determined. The CHP's investigation is ongoing,"" a spokesman for the CHP said. ""The CHP has already informed the Pest Control Advisory Section of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department about the case to carry out rodent control measures and a survey as appropriate,"" the spokesman added.

The exact mode of transmission of rat HEV to humans is unknown at the moment. Possible routes of transmission include ingestion of food or water contaminated by rodents or their excreta, exposure to environments or objects contaminated jj by rodents or their excreta, and direct contact with rodents or their excreta. The usual HEV causing human infection is transmitted mainly through the fecal-oral route.

To prevent hepatitis E infection, members of the public should maintain good personal, food, and environmental hygiene. For example, they should wash hands thoroughly before eating, store food properly or in the refrigerator, not leave food at room temperature for a long time, and use 1:99 diluted household bleach for general household cleaning and disinfection as household detergent may not be able to kill HEV. High-risk individuals, such as elderly persons with a major underlying illness (especially those who have undergone organ transplantation), pregnant women, patients with chronic liver disease, and patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (also known as G6PD deficiency), who are infected with HEV may develop a serious illness, so they should exercise extra caution.

The 5 keys to food safety should be adopted when handling food, i.e., choose (choose safe raw materials), clean (keep hands and utensils clean), separate (separate raw and cooked food), cook (cook thoroughly), and safe temperature (keep food at a safe temperature), to prevent food-borne diseases.

- Drink only boiled water from the mains or bottled drinks from reliable sources.
- Avoid drinks with ice of unknown origin.
- Purchase fresh food from hygienic and reliable sources. Do not patronize illegal hawkers.
- Clean and wash food thoroughly. Cook food, especially seafood (e.g. shellfish), pork and pig offal, thoroughly before consumption. Avoid raw food or undercooked food.
- Slice raw meat and offal into thin strips to allow thorough cooking, especially during hotpot or congee cooking.
- For sliced pig liver, depending on the thickness and quantity, boil at 100 deg Celsius [212 deg F] or stir-fry in a hot skillet/wok for at least 3 to 5 minutes.
- Heating to an internal temperature of 90 deg C [194 deg F] for 90 seconds is required for cooking of molluscan shellfish. If possible, remove the shells before cooking as they impede heat penetration. Otherwise, boil at 100 deg C until their shells open; boil for a further 3 to 5 minutes afterward. Discard any shellfish that do not open during cooking.
- For meat and offal, make sure that juices are clear, not red, and blood is not visible when cutting the cooked meat and offal.
- When having hotpot, use separate chopsticks and utensils for handling raw and cooked foods to prevent cross-contamination.

In general, rodents (such as rats) can transmit multiple diseases to humans directly and indirectly. The public is advised to adopt the following measures:
- Eliminate sources of food and nesting places for rodents in the living environment. Store food in covered containers and handle pet food properly to prevent it from becoming food for rodents;
- Store all refuse and food remnants in dustbins with well-fitted covers. Dustbins must be emptied at least once a day;
- Keep premises, especially refuse rooms and stairways, clean. Avoid accumulation of articles;
- Inspect all flower beds and pavements for rodent infestation regularly; and
- Avoid the high-risk activities below to reduce rodent contact: avoid rodent contact and places dirtied with rodent excreta; avoid handling rodents with bare hands; wash hands with liquid soap and water immediately after handling animals, and disinfect contaminated areas; and if a wound appears, clean the broken skin immediately and cover it properly with waterproof adhesive dressings.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
""Background
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) variants belonging to _Orthohepevirus_ species A (HEV-A) are the primary cause of human hepatitis E. However, we previously reported that _Orthohepevirus_ species C genotype 1 (HEV-C1), a divergent HEV variant commonly found in rats, also causes hepatitis in humans. Here, we present a clinical-epidemiological investigation of human HEV-C1 infections detected in Hong Kong, with an emphasis on outcomes in immunocompromised individuals.

""Methods
A surveillance system for detecting human HEV-C1 infections was established in Hong Kong. Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of HEV-C1 cases identified via this system between 1 Aug 2019 and 31 Dec 2020 were retrieved. Phylogenetic analysis of HEV-C1 strain sequences was performed. Infection outcomes of immunocompromised individuals with HEV-A and HEV-C1 infections were analyzed.

""Results
HEV-C1 accounted for 8 of 53 (15.1%) reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed HEV infections in Hong Kong during the study period, raising the total number of HEV-C1 infections detected in the city to 16. 2 distinct HEV-C1 strain groups caused human infections. Patients were elderly and/or immunocompromised; half tested negative for HEV immunoglobulin M. Cumulatively, HEV-C1 accounted for 9 of 21 (42.9%) cases of hepatitis E recorded in immunocompromised patients in Hong Kong. Immunocompromised HEV-C1 patients progressed to persistent hepatitis at similar rates (7/9 [77.8%]) as HEV-A patients (10/12 [75%]). HEV-C1 patients responded to oral ribavirin, although the response to the 1st course was sometimes poor or delayed.

""Conclusions
Dedicated RT-PCR-based surveillance detected human HEV-C1 cases that evade conventional hepatitis E diagnostic testing. Immunosuppressed HEV-C1-infected patients frequently progress to persistent HEV-C1 infection, for which ribavirin is a suitable treatment option.""

Additionally, a case was reported from Canada in 2019:
Andonov A, Robbins M, Borlang J, et al. Rat hepatitis E virus linked to severe acute hepatitis in an immunocompetent patient. J Infect Dis. 2019; 220(6): 951-955; <https://academic.oup.com/jid/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiz025/5288497>.

A case was also reported in Spain:
Rivero-Juarez A, Frias M, Perez AB, et al. _Orthohepevirus_ C infection as an emerging cause of acute hepatitis in Spain: 1st report in Europe. J Hepatol. 2022; 77(2): 326-331; <https://www.journal-of-hepatology.eu/article/S0168-8278(22)00075-7/fulltext>.

Likely other countries will also report cases.

It is important to know that diagnostic testing for this virus, now reported in Europe and North America after first characterized in Hong Kong, can be problematic. - Mod.LL

Infection outcomes of immunocompromised individuals with HEV-A and HEV-C1 infections were analyzed.""ResultsHEV-C1 accounted for 8 of 53 (15.1%) reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed HEV infections in Hong Kong during the study period, raising the total number of HEV-C1 infections detected in the city to 16. 2 distinct HEV-C1 strain groups caused human infections. Patients were elderly and/or immunocompromised; half tested negative for HEV immunoglobulin M. Cumulatively, HEV-C1 accounted for 9 of 21 (42.9%) cases of hepatitis E recorded in immunocompromised patients in Hong Kong. Immunocompromised HEV-C1 patients progressed to persistent hepatitis at similar rates (7/9 [77.8%]) as HEV-A patients (10/12 [75%]). HEV-C1 patients responded to oral ribavirin, although the response to the 1st course was sometimes poor or delayed.""ConclusionsDedicated RT-PCR-based surveillance detected human HEV-C1 cases that evade conventional hepatitis E diagnostic testing. Immunosuppressed HEV-C1-infected patients frequently progress to persistent HEV-C1 infection, for which ribavirin is a suitable treatment option.""Additionally, a case was reported from Canada in 2019:Andonov A, Robbins M, Borlang J, et al. Rat hepatitis E virus linked to severe acute hepatitis in an immunocompetent patient.

Abstract
--------
""Rabies is a serious public health issue in Kazakhstan, with high economic impact and social burden. As part of a routine surveillance, 31 rabies-positive brain specimens taken from livestock (cattle) and carnivores (dogs, foxes, cats) during 2013-2021 were subject to viral sequencing. Phylogenetic and Bayesian analysis were performed using obtained rabies virus (RABV) sequences. All 31 strains of RABV candidate belonged to the Cosmopolitan clade, of which 30 strains belonged to the steppe-type subclade, and 1 dog strain belonged to another subclade. The 31 strains did not diverge from RABV strains in Kazakhstan and neighboring countries, including Russia, Mongolia, and China, suggesting that animal rabies has close relationship and transmission between borders. Fox-originated strains and cattle strains shared similar sequence signatures, and some animal rabies cases had space-time intersection, showing that infected foxes were a major transmission source of cattle rabies in different Kazakhstan regions. Besides, free-roaming dogs played a pivotal role in rabies epizootics of cattle in Kazakhstan. The recent spread of animal rabies presents an increasing threat to public health and provides updated information for improving current control and prevention strategies at the source for Kazakhstan and neighboring countries.""

According to the Statens Serum Institut (SSI), the number of people affected by invasive group A streptococci cases (iGAS), where streptococci spread and cause serious conditions, has increased significantly. In November 2022 there were 21 cases, [ProMED previously posted 68 cases reported in December 2022 in Denmark], and in January this year [2023], 99 cases were reported in Denmark.

It is still mainly the elderly and children under 5 who are affected by the invasive cases. These can be, for example, blood poisoning, severe pneumonia with spread to the lung cavity [empyema], meningitis, and joint and muscle infections.

At the moment, 3 to 4 new cases are detected every day, which is 3 times the normal rate. Doctors are therefore encouraged to be extra vigilant.

""It is still important for doctors to be aware that there is widespread infection with GAS, which mainly manifests itself as strep throat and scarlet fever, but which is currently also causing an increased number of cases of invasive disease"" -- Department manager and department doctor Peter Henrik Andersen from SSI.

However, the mortality rate for patients with invasive disease is at the same level as the period before November 2022. A few deaths have been seen among young children.

SSI continuously examines the streptococcal samples that have caused invasive disease, which are sent from all the country's clinical microbiology departments. 35% of the total cases are due to a new subvariant that has not previously been seen in Denmark. It has been observed in all parts of the country.

The non-invasive infections will typically manifest as throat and superficial skin infections. In some cases, GAS will give rise to more serious invasive cases, that is, infections detected in blood or other normally sterile areas. GAS are always sensitive to regular penicillin and its lack of effect should lead to renewed medical assessment.

[A discussion of infections due to group A streptococcus (also called GAS or _Streptococcus pyogenes_) can be found in my moderator comments in ProMED post Streptococcus, gp A update (05): UK, fatal, scarlet fever, iGAS 20221231.8707549.

Life-threatening invasive GAS infections (iGAS) are currently being reported in both children and elderly adults in the USA, Canada, the UK, some countries in the EU, Uruguay, and Australia (see also's below) at a time of increasing cases of localized GAS infections (for example, pharyngitis and scarlet fever). iGAS disease can involve abscesses around the tonsils or in the neck, bacteremia, pneumonia, empyema, endocarditis, meningitis, necrotizing fasciitis, and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome.

The incidence of iGAS infections has increased compared to the period when COVID-19 pandemic control measures were in place and exposure to GAS infections was likely infrequent. Also, iGAS infections are known to complicate certain viral infections; GAS pneumonia and empyema are now occurring when respiratory viruses, such as influenza or RSV, have become more prevalent. Similarly, invasive GAS infections of the skin and soft tissues may complicate chickenpox. Other complications of chickenpox due to bacterial super-infections include bacterial pneumonia, septicemia, toxic shock syndrome, necrotizing fasciitis, osteomyelitis, and septic arthritis (<https://www.cdc.gov/chickenpox/hcp/index.html#complications>).

The news report above adds 2 points of new information to the previous of ProMED post on iGAS in Denmark (Streptococcus, gp A update (03): Denmark, invasive, increase, 2022 20230123.8707920): the total number of iGAS infections in Denmark in January 2023 is 99 (compared to 21 in November 2022 and 68 in December 2022), and 35% of the total cases are due to a new subvariant GAS that has not previously been seen in Denmark. Details describing the characteristics of this new subvariant strain were not given. In the UK, the majority of the current emm1 GAS isolates were noted to be part of the emm1 M1UK clone, first detected in 2010, for which there is upregulation of streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (SpeA) expression, a virulence factor of _Streptococcus pyogenes_ (Streptococcus, gp A update (01): Netherlands, UK, iGAS, fatal, children, 2022 20230107.8707666).

Heavy rainfalls and extreme heat have affected the Eastern Cape hard, causing damage to the agricultural and farming sectors, especially due to the instability of the weather. Extreme weather conditions have badly affected farmers and livestock producers. 

In an interview with RACR (Rural Action for Climate Resilience), a few farmers say that they have noticed lumpy skin disease [LSD] in their livestock.

The virus affects cattle and is transmitted by insects that feed on blood, such as flies, mosquitoes, and ticks. It causes fever and nodules on the skin and can lead to death.

N.F. from Zibhodla village in Mqanduli is a young farmer; he explains to RACR that climate change resulting in extreme weather conditions have caused a new virus which makes cows, sheep, and horses to experience swelling, begin limping, and to lose appetite [see comment]. He tells RACR that he believes this new virus is caused by too much rainfall and extreme heat conditions. ""I plead with the government to assist all the communities that are affected by this virus so we can at the same time prevent the ones that are not yet infected"". 

Z.P. explains they are unable to isolate the infected cows, exposing healthy livestock to the risk of infection. ""We would truly appreciate it if the Department of Agrarian Reform would assist us by sending vets and medications or injections; seeing a lot of your livestock as a farmer die every day does hurt a lot"".

The farmers want the government and the department to intervene. They tell RACR that they cannot afford the necessary medications for this virus, and they also plead that the department goes to their communities to educate people in rural areas about these extreme weather conditions and viruses that attack livestock and help them find ways to prevent spreading any further threat to their livestock.

[Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is caused by lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV), a virus from the family _Poxviridae_, genus _Capripoxvirus_. Sheeppox virus and goatpox virus are the 2 other virus species in this genus. 

The most typical changes caused by LSD in affected cattle are cutaneous nodules of 2-5 cm in diameter which develop, particularly on the head, neck, limbs, udder, genitalia, and perineum within 48 hours of the onset of the febrile reaction. These nodules involve the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and even the underlying muscles, and sometimes the lungs and digestive tract.
 
Morbidity rate varies between 10 and 20% although it has been reported in some places to be as high as 45%. Mortality rates of 1 to 5% are considered usual. 

LSD was first seen in Zambia in 1929, spreading into Botswana by 1943, and then into South Africa, where it affected over 8 million cattle causing major economic loss. In 1957, it entered Kenya and in 1970, spread north into Sudan and by the late 80's becoming regarded as endemic in most African countries. Later it spread into the Middle East, and since 2012, through the Middle East, into southeast Europe and West and Central Asia. Since 2019, LSD has spread to other parts of Asia, including China and India. 

Potent live-attenuated vaccines are effective and widely used in affected countries.

It causes fever and nodules on the skin and can lead to death.N.F. from Zibhodla village in Mqanduli is a young farmer; he explains to RACR that climate change resulting in extreme weather conditions have caused a new virus which makes cows, sheep, and horses to experience swelling, begin limping, and to lose appetite [see comment]. He tells RACR that he believes this new virus is caused by too much rainfall and extreme heat conditions. ""I plead with the government to assist all the communities that are affected by this virus so we can at the same time prevent the ones that are not yet infected"". Z.P. explains they are unable to isolate the infected cows, exposing healthy livestock to the risk of infection. ""We would truly appreciate it if the Department of Agrarian Reform would assist us by sending vets and medications or injections; seeing a lot of your livestock as a farmer die every day does hurt a lot"".The farmers want the government and the department to intervene. They tell RACR that they cannot afford the necessary medications for this virus, and they also plead that the department goes to their communities to educate people in rural areas about these extreme weather conditions and viruses that attack livestock and help them find ways to prevent spreading any further threat to their livestock.[Byline: Lindiwe Pakati]--Communicated by:ProMED from HealthMap Alerts[Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is caused by lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV), a virus from the family _Poxviridae_, genus _Capripoxvirus_. Sheeppox virus and goatpox virus are the 2 other virus species in this genus. The most typical changes caused by LSD in affected cattle are cutaneous nodules of 2-5 cm in diameter which develop, particularly on the head, neck, limbs, udder, genitalia, and perineum within 48 hours of the onset of the febrile reaction. These nodules involve the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and even the underlying muscles, and sometimes the lungs and digestive tract. Morbidity rate varies between 10 and 20% although it has been reported in some places to be as high as 45%. Mortality rates of 1 to 5% are considered usual. LSD was first seen in Zambia in 1929, spreading into Botswana by 1943, and then into South Africa, where it affected over 8 million cattle causing major economic loss. In 1957, it entered Kenya and in 1970, spread north into Sudan and by the late 80's becoming regarded as endemic in most African countries. Later it spread into the Middle East, and since 2012, through the Middle East, into southeast Europe and West and Central Asia. Since 2019, LSD has spread to other parts of Asia, including China and India. Potent live-attenuated vaccines are effective and widely used in affected countries.

A crop disease that has yet to be identified is devastating maize fields in Chuadanga district. The disease first dries the plant's roots causing them to eventually rot, resulting in the damage of cobs during the milk stage. Overall, over 6 hectares [14.8 acres] of maize have been affected in the area. The Bangladesh Wheat and Maize Research Institute has sent off a team of scientists to investigate the situation. They hope to know a reason within a couple of days.

Farmers say that there was a similar outbreak in 2020, but the extent of damage is far more widespread in 2023. Crops planted early in the season are being affected; it is a very big problem for growers when any disease causes plant roots to rot. Farmers ask that the government should deal will this issue on a priority basis to protect the crops from further damage.

[A large number of pathogens are known to affect maize in the region and worldwide. Root rots of the crop can be caused by a range of mainly fungal and bacterial pathogens. Symptoms as described above can be due to several of them or be caused by environmental factors. Any root disease may also affect development of the cobs by reducing plant vigour and disrupting nutrient transport.

A reliable diagnosis of the cause(s) is always essential before any management strategies can be designed. The prediction above of getting a clear molecular diagnosis within a few days seems very optimistic.

An outbreak of FMD (foot and mouth disease) that infects cattle in Ponorogo Regency, East Java [also known as Jawa Timur - Mod.JH] is showing a sharp increasing trend: from the under 100 cases previously reported, now more than 300 cattle have been infected.

""Yes, most cases currently detected are in Sawoo District with 104 cases. The increased number of cases is suspected to be due to the non-optimal vaccination coverage"", said Head of the Livestock Service Office, Food Security and Fisheries of Ponorogo Regency, Masun, in Ponorogo, Sunday [19 Feb 2023].

He added, ""currently there are 8 cows that have died due to FMD.

""The most deficient vaccination rate is seen in Sawoo, Siman and Bungkal. Since the cattle in Pudak District have been 100% vaccinated, there has been just one case there, an animal kept outside the city"", he said.

According to Masun, the deficient vaccination rate in the Ponorogo Regency may be attributed to one of the following scenarios: 
1. the breeders introduced unvaccinated animals (no eartags) from elsewhere, and/or
2. local cows have escaped vaccination. Such animals are mainly found in the districts of Sawoo, Siman and Bungkal.

To minimize transmission, continued Masun, so far his party has sprayed disinfectants at the animal market twice.

""We will continue to carry out biosecurity, spraying disinfectants before and after the market opens,"" he said.

Masun appealed to the public, especially breeders to be proactive with vaccination officers, so that the process of mitigating outbreaks or prevention efforts can be optimal.

[It is necessary to continuously monitor the efficacy of the vaccine used and the (maintained) identity of the circulating virus strain. For this end, vaccinated animals ought to be sampled in case they present clinical signs, to check in the laboratory if the causative pathogen matches the initial virus strain, against which the vaccine was supposed to confer protection. There are ample examples of FMD events in which more than a single FMD strain or even serotype were involved, leading to confusion. Identifying such animals in Indonesia should be possible since, as it seems from the media report, they are ear-tagged when vaccinated. 

Indonesia's Ministry of Agriculture operates a website dedicated to the continuing FMD epizootic. The website presents (daily) updates on the course of the disease (number and locations of currently active cases, total confirmed cases, recovered, deaths, slaughtered) and of the vaccination performance. The data are spatial, to the level of districts and subdistricts within each province, while attending to each of the following animal species: beef cattle, dairy cattle, water buffalo, pigs, sheep and goats. A dynamic, interactive map is available at <https://crisiscenterpmk.ditjenpkh.pertanian.go.id/peta-terdampak-pmk/?l=en>. Currently, only one province, East Java, is coloured red, meaning that the number of subdistricts with active FMD cases exceeds 50% of the total number of the subdistricts in the province. Bali is among the provinces coloured aqua, meaning zero cases. The disease peaked in late 2022. 

Among the other data: totals (accumulated), 602 206 confirmed cases, of which 563 971 clinically recovered, 14 263 slaughtered, 11 174 deaths, 11 939 684 doses vaccine applied. All data are also presented per province, district, subdistrict, cities, as well as per animal species. The disease peaked on 26 Jun 2022, when 13 559 new cases were reported. - Mod.AS]

[Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) virus has been recognized in Japan since 2013 and has been spreading in the country since then. The number of human cases reported by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases was a record 110 people infected in 2021, followed by a record 118 in 2022. The above report does not indicate the number of cases so far this year (2023), but is probably too early in the season for tick activity. It will be interesting to see how many cases occur in Japan in coming months this year (2023).

SFTS is likely underreported in some areas. SFTS should be included in differential diagnoses when cases of _Rickettsia japonica_ infections are suspected. Since there is no vaccine, the best way to avoid infection is to avoid tick bites and contact with infected pets, especially cats.

As noted earlier, SFTS is a serious disease and of significant public health concern. Although SFTS virus infections may be serious, there is evidence for subclinical or mild infections as well, so the previous numbers may be an underestimate of the total number of infections. There is also some evidence for person-to-person direct transmission of the virus, but that appears to be a rare event. The virus is doubtless endemic in several countries in Asia, and cases have occurred previously in Japan. Apparently, there are 2 previously reported affected individuals who acquired their infections directly from an SFTS-virus-infected cat. No mention was made of tick transmission in that instance. The possible route of transmission from the cat to the veterinarian and veterinary nurse via exposure to blood or other bodily fluids was not mentioned (see Severe fever w/ thrombocytopenia synd. - East Asia (02): Japan (MZ) 20181211.6204927). The role of infected domestic companion animals as threats for transmission directly to humans in contact with them is not well defined. They certainly could carry infected ticks into areas where humans are present as well. 

SFTS virus is a tick-transmitted phlebovirus in the Bunyavirus family. Images of the longhorn tick, _Haemaphysalis longicornis_, the SFTS vector, can be seen at <http://www.lowchensaustralia.com/pests/paralysis-tick/haemaphysalis-longicornis-description.htm>. - Mod.TY
